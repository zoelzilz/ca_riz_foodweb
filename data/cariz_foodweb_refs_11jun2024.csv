An analysis of octopus d d holes in empty snail shells indicates that 0. bimaculatus is a major s n d predator in the community. The addition of marked snails to a natural reef with unmanipulated octopus densities demonstrated that octopuses can quickly reduce s n d abundances, consuming 24 % of the available snails within 24 d. During 5 yr at 1 site, octopus abundance declined from 40 to 8 octopuses, while total prey abundance increased from 16 to 80 ind m-'. A second site experienced a similar drop in octopus density and increase in prey density over 3 yr. At both sites, snails and hermit crabs showed the greatest increases. Sedentary grazers, bivalves, and crabs and shrimps occurred at low densities throughout, possibly because the abundances of these preferred prey were depressed by octopus predation even during years of low octopus density. In splte of the strong negative association at the 2 sltes between octopus and prey over time, for a single time penod at 15 different s ~ t epsrey densities were not negatively correlated w t h the densities of their predators. However, octopus densities were much higher when they appeared to reduce the abundances of their prey than when the 15 different sites were sampled. I conclude that octopus predation can dramatically reduce prey densities when octopuses are unusually common, but that in most years the abundance of octopuses 1s too low to disrupt the basic patterns of prey abundance that result from other processes. The h g h e s t prey species richness and diversity at the 2 study sites occurred during years of lowest octopus densities. Species richness, chversity and evenness of the prey assemblage were not correlated with octopus, lobster or predatory gastropod abundances at the 15 different locations; when the effects of habitat structure were held constant by partial correlation, seastar abundance was negatively correlated with species nchness and diversity. The relation between predation and species chversity suggests that, when predation is effective in this assemblage, it decreases diversity.",1986,261-273,,,30,,Mar. Ecol. Prog.

Although shelters may be scarce in some areas, it appears that shelters generally do not limit the size of O. bimaculatus populations. Shelters suitable for habitation by adult and juvenile O. bimaculatus were always in excess during this study. Nearly half of the population studied inhabited their shelter for more than a month, and a few octopuses occupied the same shelter for at least 5 months. One fourth of the population spent less than a week in the same shelter, and many of these may have changed shelters every day. However, nearly all octopuses remained in the same area.

Hexacanth embryos within nonoperculate, untanned eggs collected from round stingray developed in the tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus into caudate procercoids with an apical organ/sucker and cercomer, and rarely, bothridia. The procercoids, which developed in the body cavity within a membrane, adhered to the copepod intestine, were infective to arrow gobies, Clevelandia ios, within 15 d of exposure at 21°C. When infected copepods were fed to arrow gobies, procercoids developed into nonlacunate plerocercoids each bearing individually retractable bothridia and an apical sucker. Within 10 d of exposure to the second intermediate host, the larvae had migrated up the bile/cystic duct into the gall bladder, where they developed bothridia similar to those of adult worms. Between 30 to 51 d post-infection in the goby, plerocercoids approached the size of larvae found in natural infections, and the scolex became morphologically similar to that of adult worms from round stingrays. Only presumptive ﬁliform microtriches (ﬁlitriches) were present on procercoids while both ﬁlitrichs and spiniform microtriches (spinitrichs) were present on plerocercoids. Identiﬁcation of plerocercoids from experimental infections as those of R. urobatidium was conﬁrmed through morphology of the scolex and using cytochrome c oxidase I sequences. The experimental transmission of R. urobatidium to ﬁrst and second intermediate hosts provides improved understanding of the transmission and ontogeny of shark tapeworms.

For algae from feces and pellets, light-saturated photosynthetic rates (Pmax) were 85 and 13%, respectively, of Pmax of freshly isolated zooxanthellae; and were 20 and 46%, respectively, for zoochlorellae. The photosynthetic pigments and mitotic index (percent of dividing cells) were not altered by the feeding activities of the leather star.

Along the west coast of North America, herbivory by fishes on nearshore reefs is largely restricted to a few members of the Kyphosidae, distributed south of Pt. Conception. This paper presents information on natural diets and results from feeding choice experiments for two abundant kyphosids from intertidal habitats in San Diego, California —Girella nigricans andHermosilla azurea, and similar data for the lined shore crab,Pachygrapsus crassipes, which also forages over intertidal reefs. These results are compared with the availability of algae in intertidal habitats measured during summer and winter, on both disturbed and undisturbed habitats. The diets of juveniles ofG. nigricans andH. azurea collected from nearshore habitats were dominated by animal prey (mainly amphipods), but adults of these fishes, andP. crassipes, consumed algae nearly exclusively, with 26, 10, and 14 taxa of algae identified fromG. nigricans, H. azurea, andP. crassipes, respectively. Algae with sheet-like morphologies (e.g.Ulva sp.,Enteromorpha sp., members of the Delesseriaceae) were the principal algae in the diets of the fishes, and calcareous algae (e.g.Corallina sp.,Lithothrix aspergillum) and sheet-like algae (Enteromorpha sp.) comprised the greatest identifiable portion of the shore crab's diet. Feeding choice experiments indicated that the fishes preferred filamentous algae (e.g.Centroceras clavulatum, Polysiphonia sp.,Chondria californica) and sheet-like algae (e.g.Enteromorpha sp.,Ulva sp.,Cryptopleura crispa) over other algal morphologies, whereas the shore crab chose jointed calcareous algae (e.g.Lithothrix aspergillum, Corallina vancouveriensis, Jania sp.) most frequently. The diets and preferences for algae by the fishes were generally most similar to the assemblage of algae available in early successional (disturbed) habitats during summer when sheet-like and filamentous algae are abundant. The shore crab exhibited the opposite trend with a diet more similar to late successional (undisturbed) habitats.",5/1/93,75-95,,1,37,,Environ Biol Fish,,,,,,,"Barry, J. P., & Ehret, M. J. (1993).

Epifaunal crustacea was the major prey group identified from stomach contents of more than 2,000 fishes, followed by epifaunal and infaunal worms, and molluscs. Overall, 18 fish species consumed 263 different prey taxa, ranging from 10 taxa to 125 taxa per fish species and including 99 crustacean, 56 polychaete, and 39 molluscan taxa. Mean prey richness was greatest at stations near the ocean and lowest at inshore stations. Detailed dietary data for all prey taxa were summarized as trophic spectra for each fish species. Trophic spectra represented functional groups of prey and were used for comparisons of dietary similarity. Cluster analyses, based on trophic spectra, resulted in four feeding guilds of fishes. Of 18 fish species, seven (Amphistichus argenteus, Leptocottus armatus, Embiotoca jacksoni, Clevelandia ios, Gillichthys mirabilis, Cymatogaster aggregata, andCitharichthys stimaeus) fed principally on epifaunal crustacea. Four species (Pleuronectes vetulus, Platichthys stellatus, Phanerodon furcatus, andMyliobatus californica) consumed mostly molluscs and infaunal worms. Two species (Psettichthys melanostictus andTriakis semifasciata) fed on mobile crustacea, and five species (Hyperprosopon anale, Engraulis mordax, Clupea pallasi, Atherinopsis californiensis, andAtherinops affinis) fed largely on zooplankton and plant material.

Symbioses can be characterized as commensal, mutualistic, or, more rarely, parasitic. Symbioses are found in caridean and stenopodidean but not in dendrobranchiate shrimps. The morphology and feeding behavior of many symbiotic shrimps have been adapted to living with their hosts. A number of symbiotic shrimps live within the canals of sponges, receiving protection and food. The social organization of Synalpheus sponge shrimps varies from pair-living to communality to eusociality most similar to that of termites. Shrimps living with corals, anemones, and jellyfishes may both receive or give protection to their hosts, in addition to food and shelter. Many shrimp species live among the spines or below sea urchins. Other echinoderms, such as ophiuroids, starfishes, and especially crinoids, serve as shrimp hosts. Some shrimps live with molluscs, especially within shells of bivalves, feeding on the food-laden mucus or feces of the host. Still others have a similar lifestyle within branchial or atrial chambers of ascidians. Some shrimps share the burrows made by invertebrates and other crustaceans. A unique mutualistic relationship has evolved between alpheid shrimps and gobiid fishes, in which a male–female shrimp pair give the fish shelter in their burrow while the fish provides both food and a warning system.

One proposed mechanism that could drive this gradient is a physiological constraint due to temperature. One prediction based on this mechanism is that if herbivorous fishes could shift their diet to animal material, they would be better able to grow, survive, and reproduce in cold waters. We tested this prediction on the omnivore Girella nigricans under different temperature and diet regimes using RNA–DNA ratios as an indicator of performance. Fish had increased performance (100%) at low temperatures (12 °C) when their diet was supplemented with animal material. In contrast, at higher temperatures (17, 22, and 27 °C) fish showed no differences between diets. This indicates that omnivorous fishes could increase their performance at low temperatures by consuming more animal matter. This study supports the hypothesis that a relative increase in the nutritional value of plant material at warmer temperatures could drive the latitudinal diversity gradient in herbivorous fishes.",6/29/07,867-873,,6,64,,Can.

Throughout most of its geographic range, from Southern California to central Baja California, the opaleye (Girella nigricans) fed primarily on red and green algae, but there was significant variation in the amount of algal material in the diet among sites. The proportion of algal material in the diet was related to habitat, with algae making up a larger proportion of a fish’s diet in algal-dominated habitats than in urchin barrens. Independent of habitat, the proportion of algal material in the diet increased with environmental temperature. Analyses of stable isotopes revealed similar changes in trophic position and confirmed that these associations with diet persisted over relatively long time scales. The shift to a more herbivorous diet at warmer temperatures is in agreement with past laboratory studies on this species that show a diet-dependent change in performance with temperature and can indicate a diet shift across the species’ geographic range to meet its physiological demands. A possible plastic response to herbivory was a longer gut relative to body size.

The rapidly growing field of community phylogenetics has generated debate about the choice between functional traits and phylogenetic relationships for understanding species similarities, and has raised additional questions about the contribution of experimental vs. observational approaches to understanding evolutionary constraints on community assembly. In this study, we use traits, a phylogeny, and field surveys to identify the forces structuring communities of herbivorous marine amphipods and isopods living in adjacent seagrass and macroalgae. In addition, we compare our field results to a recently published mesocosm experiment that tested the effects of both trait and phylogenetic diversity on coexistence using the same species and system. With respect to community assembly processes, we found that environmental filtering was the dominant process in macroalgae habitats, that niche partitioning was the dominant process in seagrass habitats, and that the strength of these assembly mechanisms varied with seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions and resource availability. These patterns are indicated by both phylogenetic relationships and trait distances, but the type of resources being partitioned in seagrass habitats can only be deciphered using trait data. Species coexisting in seagrass in the field differed not in their feeding niche but in traits related to microhabitat use, providing novel evidence of the relative importance of competition for food vs. habitat in structuring communities of phytophagous invertebrates. With respect to methodology, the results for seagrass habitats conflict with those obtained in mesocosms, where feeding trait diversity did promote coexistence and phylogenetic diversity had no effect. This contrast arises because a greater range of traits (some of which have much stronger phylogenetic signal than feeding traits) contribute to community assembly in the field. This highlights a mismatch between the processes that drive community assembly in the field and the processes we isolated in experimental tests, and illustrates that using phylogeny as a single proxy in both contexts may impede the synthesis of observational and experimental results.",2014,775-786,,3,95,,,,,,,,,"Best, R.

Among 73 shark species documented in the eastern North Pacific (ENP), less than half reach maximum lengths >200cm, and 78% occur in demersal or benthic regions of the continental shelf or slope. Most small (≤200cm) species (e.g., houndsharks) and demersal, nearshore juveniles of larger species (e.g., requiem sharks) consume small teleosts and decapod crustaceans, whereas large species in pelagic coastal and oceanic environments feed on large teleosts and squids. Several large, pelagic apex predator species occur in the ENP, but the largest species (i.e., Basking Shark, Whale Shark) consume zooplankton or small nekton. Size-based dietary variability is substantial for many species, and segregation of juvenile and adult foraging habitats also is common (e.g., Horn Shark, Shortfin Mako). Temporal dietary differences are most pronounced for temperate, nearshore species with wide size ranges, and least pronounced for smaller species in extreme latitudes and deep-water regions. Sympatric sharks often occupy various trophic positions, with resource overlap differing by space and time and some sharks serving as prey to other species. Most coastal species remain in the same general region over time and feed opportunistically on variable prey inputs (e.g., season migrations, spawning, or recruitment events), whereas pelagic, oceanic species actively seek hot spots of prey abundance that are spatiotemporally variable. The influence of sharks on ecosystem structure and regulation has been downplayed compared to that of large teleosts species with higher per capita consumption rates (e.g., tunas, billfishes). However, sharks also exert indirect influences on prey populations by causing behavioural changes that may result in restricted ranges and reduced fitness.

Based on the analysis, three subclasses, the Polyonchoinea, Polystomatoinea and Oligonchoinca, are recognised. The analysis supports independent origins of the Montchadskyellidae within the Polyonchoinea and of the Neodactylodiscidae and Amphibdellatidae within the order Dactylogyridea (Polyonchoinea); the suborder Montchadskyellinea is raised to ordinal status and new suborders Neodactylodiscinea and Amphibdellatinea are proposed to reflect these origins. The Gyrodactylidea (Polyonchoinca) is supported by three synapomorphies and comprises the Gyrodactylidae, Anoplodiscidae, Tetraonchoididae and Bothitrematidae. The analysis supports recognition of the Polystomatoinea comprising Polystomatidae and Sphyranuridae. Evolutionary relationships within the Oligonchoinea indicate independent origins of three ordinal taxa, the Chimaericolidea (monotypic), Diclybothriidea (including Diclybothriidae and Hexabothriidae) and Mazocraeidea (with five suborders). The suborder Mazocraeinea comprises the Plectanocotylidae, Mazocraeidae and Mazoplectidae, and is characterised by two synapomorphies. The suborder Gastrocotylinea, characterised by presence of accessory sclerites in the haptoral sucker, is divided into two infraorders, the monotypic Anthocotylina infraorder novum and Gastrocotylina. Two superfamilies of the Gastrocotylina are recognised, the Protomicrocotyloidea and Gastrocotyloidea; the Pseudodiclidophoridae is considered incertae sedis within the Gastrocotylina. The suborder Discocotylinea comprises the Discocotylidae, Octomacridae and Diplozoidae and is supported by four synapomorphies. The monotypic Hexostomatinea suborder novum is proposed to reflect an independent origin of the Hexostomatidae within the Mazocraeidea. The terminal suborder Microcotylinea comprises four superfamilies, the Microcotyloidea, Allopyragraphoroidea, Diclidophoroidea and Pyragraphoroidea.

Two of the Gulf idoteids appear to be of subtropical or tropical origin (Eusymmerus antennatus and Colidotea findleyi), whereas the others appear to be cold or warm temperate derived species (Erichsonella cortezi, Idotea aculeata, I. urotoma, I. stenops, I. resecata, and I. wosnesenskii). These findings suggest, as other distributional data have, that the family Idoteidae is composed largely of cool to warm temperate-centered taxa, with few modern genera and species having evolved in the lower latitudes (e.g., Eusymmerus, Colidotea, and some species of Erichsonella). Members of this family, in the tropical and subtropical east Pacific, are generally found in association with littoral and shallow-water algae, especially species of Sargassum. Four species of Idotea are extremely wide-ranging forms, suggesting that members of this genus may be considerably more eurythermal than previously suspected.

This investigation deals with the feeding biology of Hyadesia fusca taking as an example a population located on an artificial rocky shore of the middle Weser estuary in Northern Germany. The species is characterized by a broad diet range; in feeding experiments diatoms, lichens, detritus as well as blue, red and green algae were accepted. Even analyses of faecal pellets produced by field specimen suggest a non-specific feeding habit. However, the influence of certain diets on mortality, offspring number and rearing success showed that the food quality differs significantly. The most suitable food, the Ulvaceae Blidingia, was clearly preferred in a series of pairwise choice tests. These findings correlate with the vertical zonation of the field population i.e.: higher population densities in the vegetation zone dominated by Blidingia.

Among other variables affecting faunal assemblages, sedimentation, food supply and oxygen concentration within mats or turfs of coralline algae may greatly depend on the exposure to waves. In this study, peracarid assemblages were compared at replicated rocky shores within different levels of wave exposure, along a coastline in south-eastern Brazil. Overall amphipod diversity (11 species) was much higher than tanaidacean diversity (two species). Correlation analyses did not support any biological interactions between amphipods and tanaidaceans. Habitat complexity, while apparently limiting amphipod populations, did not affect tanaidaceans at a local scale. Amphipod abundance, not assemblage structure, was positively affected by wave exposure, probably improving oxygen concentration levels and renewal of food resources. Rather than abundance, which remains fairly stable, exposure to waves determined species identity in tanaidaceans, with Zeuxo coralensis found at exposed shores and Leptochelia aff. dubia found at sheltered shores, except for two L. aff. dubia individuals found at one of the exposed sites.

Evisceration started in September and continued through November. By November 1982, 76% of the holothurians at one site and 49% at a second site had eviscerated. Specimens collected in the following winter months had regenerating or newly functional digestive tracts. Regeneration under natural conditions takes approximately 2–4 weeks. The extent of annual evisceration appears to be variable from year to year. Seasonal evisceration may serve as an economic autotomy excretory mechanism, whereby waste-laden digestive tracts are discarded after an active summer of feeding. The induction of autumnal evisceration is probably a complex interaction of internal and environmental factors.

Here we show that increases in the annual frequency of severe storms lead to a decrease in the diversity and complexity of food webs of giant kelp forests, one of the most productive habitats on Earth. We demonstrate this by linking natural variation in storms with measured changes in kelp forest food web structure in the Santa Barbara Channel using structural equation modeling (SEM). We then match predictions from statistical models to results from a multiyear kelp removal experiment designed to simulate frequent large storms. Both SEM models and experiments agree: if large storms remain at their current annual frequency (roughly one major kelp-removing storm every 3.5 years), periodic storms help maintain the complexity of kelp forest food webs. However, if large storms increase in annual frequency and begin to occur year after year, kelp forest food webs become less diverse and complex as species go locally extinct. The loss of complexity occurs primarily due to decreases in the diversity and complexity of higher trophic levels.

One source of confusion has been different experimental designs. The multiple-predator effects literature typically employs an additive design, while the biodiversity ecosystem function literature typically uses a replacement design. Separately, these designs each detect only a subset of the changes in food web interactions caused by predator loss. Here, we measure the impact of consumer diversity on sessile marine invertebrates using a combination additive–replacement design. We couple this with a meta-analysis of previous combination experiments. We use these two approaches to explore how each design can detect different types of interactions among predators. We find that, while high diversity does lead to more negative interspecific interactions, the strength of these interactions is often weaker than negative intraspecific interactions caused by increasing the density of a single species alone. We conclude that a hybrid design is the optimal method to explore the mechanisms behind the effects of changing predator diversity. If researchers merely want to know the consequences of changing predator diversity, at a bare minimum, the experimental design must mimic the actual changes in both predator density and diversity in their system of interest. However, only a hybrid design can distinguish the consequences of shifting the balance of interspecific and intraspecific interactions within a community, an issue of great importance when considering both natural diversity loss and pest biocontrol.",2009,2879-2888,,10,90,,,The consequences of consumer diversity loss,,,,,,"Byrnes, J.

However, they require valid estimates of age-specific mortality and natality rates, in addition to information on the distribution, abundance, habits and reproduction of the population, to produce reliable estimates of population growth. Because such detailed ecological information is usually unavailable, complete demographic analyses have been completed for only four shark species: the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias; the soupfin shark, Galeorhinus australis; the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris; and most recently the sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus. In California, reliable estimates of age, growth, mortality, age at maturity, and fecundity are available only for the leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata. A demographic analysis of this species yielded a net reproductive rate (Ro) of 4.467, a generation time (G) of 22.35 years, and an estimate of the instantaneous population growth coefficient (r) of 0.067.

Plenosoma resembles Pseudospelotrema Yamaguti, 1939 and Maritreminoides Yoshida, 1938 in the extent of the uterus into the fore-body, but differs from them in the anterior distribution of the vitellaria, and the presence of a large, muscular genital atrium and a longitudinal genital opening. Pseudosellacotyla Yamaguti, 1954 resembles Plenosoma in the anterior distribution of the vitellaria, but differs from it in lacking a cirrus sac and possessing a bipartite seminal vesicle and a genital pore opening ventral to the acetabulum. Levinseniella Stiles & Hassall, 1902 differs from Plenosoma in possessing a more complexly organized genital atrium, and lacking a cirrus sac. Gymnophallus obscurus n.sp. resembles G. macroporus in the arrangement of the vitellaria and gonads, but its body and eggs are half the size of those of G. macroporus, and its uterus extends anteriorly to the intestinal caeca. G. obscurus resembles Parvatrema borealis in arrangement and shape of the vitellaria and body and egg size, but its genital pore lies immediately in front of the acetabulum rather than some distance anterior to it. Echinostephilla haematopi n.sp. differs from the type and only other species of the genus, E. virgula Lebour, 1909 in possessing a tapering anterior end, lacking scales on the posterior third of the body, the ovary being smaller than the testes, and having fewer (10 to 35) vitelline follicles than 40 to 60 on each side.

While this group presents a rare opportunity for evolutionary comparative study of host switching and morphological evolution in marine macroinvertebrates, previous phylogenetic studies have been focused on systematics. Here, we reconstructed the most extensive phylogeny of Pinnotheroidea based on two mitochondrial and six nuclear markers, with the aim of elucidating the host switching pathways and the correlation between symbiotic lifestyles and selected morphological adaptations. Ancestral state reconstruction of host association revealed a monophyletic origin of symbiosis in the form of inquilinism. Subsequent shifts in microhabitat preference for burrows or worm tubes, and the move to protective symbiosis, primarily in the switch to mollusc endosymbiosis, contributed to radiation in Pinnotheridae. Further parallel colonisations of echinoderms and tunicates occurred but did not lead to extensive diversification, except in the Clypeasterophilus + Dissodactylus lineage, which experienced a unique switch to echinoderm ectosymbiosis. The evolution of the third maxillipeds, carapace shape and ambulatory pereiopods suggests a rather strong coupling with the symbiotic lifestyle (whether inquilinism or protective symbiosis). Phenotypic diversity of these characters was higher among species engaged in protective symbiosis, with convergence in form (or function) among those sharing the same host affiliation. Species having different host affiliations or symbiotic lifestyles might also exhibit convergence in the form of the three morphological traits, suggesting a common adaptive value of the specialisations. Pinnotherid crabs overall exhibited a lower trait diversity than the also symbiotic palaemonid shrimps with comparable species diversity. This may plausibly be attributed to differences in potential for morphological modification to serve additional functions among the traits analysed in the two groups, the less frequent host switching and the less diverse host affiliations, and thus a less complicated evolutionary history in pinnotherids.",11/1/23,107904,,,188,,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,Shift in symbiotic lifestyle as the major process shaping the evolution of pea crabs (Decapoda,,,,,,"Chow, L.

The attacks of 18 juvenile C. analis, between 17.59 mm and 42.15 mm in standard length (SL), feeding on brown worms were filmed using high-speed video. Feeding mode, ram-or suction-dominated, kinematic variables and morphology were quantified and compared over the juvenile period. The analysis of these three factors was based on the following questions: (1) do they change over ontogeny; (2) how do their values compare with those of larvae, juveniles and adults of other species; and (3) what is the level of stereotypy, as measured by the variance in these factors, at this stage in ontogeny and does it change? Small C. analis juveniles have the small gape and large buccal cavity of a suction feeder, and this morphology becomes more pronounced as they become larger. The kinematic variables of C. analis juveniles are similar to those of adult suction-feeding cottids and least-squares regression analysis showed significant changes in only two variables (time to prey capture and absolute attack predator–prey distance) over the juvenile period. Feeding mode, as measured by the ram-suction index, shows an increase in the suction component of the strike with increasing size. This study demonstrates that, in C. analis, suction feeding behavior develops during the juvenile period. Within the juvenile stage, morphology, prey-capture kinematics and feeding mode are not tightly linked ontogenetically such that suction-feeder kinematics (short predator–prey distance and low attack velocity) and basic morphology (small gape, large buccal volume) develop much earlier than the employment of a large suction component during the strike.",9/1/96,1961-1971,,9,199,,Journal of Experimental Biology,Ontogeny of Feeding Morphology And Kinematics in Juvenile Fishes,,,,,,"Cook, A.

We collected mesozooplankton from five stations along two cross-shelf transects in the Northern California Current (NCC) during winter and summer of 2018–2019. We analyzed gut contents of 11 hydromedusan species and the prey community to (i) determine prey resource use by hydromedusae and (ii) determine temporal shifts in the trophic niche of hydromedusae, focusing on the two most collected species (Clytia gregaria and Eutonina indicans). Hydromedusae in the NCC fed mostly on copepods, appendicularians and invertebrate larvae. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of hydromedusan diets showed seasonal shifts in prey resource driven by the abundant C. gregaria, which fed mostly on copepod eggs during winter and fed mostly on appendicularians and copepods during summer. Prey selectivity for copepod eggs increased during winter for C. gregaria and E. indicans. Intriguingly, theoretical ingestion rates show that both species acquire similar amounts of carbon during upwelling and nonupwelling conditions.

Selection patterns varied between species, but were largely replicable between sample dates and resembled dietary patterns found in similar studies from neighboring regions. Ambush-foraging medusae (Aglantha digitale, Sarsia tubulosa, and Proboscidactyla flavicirrata) fed primarily on crustacean and ciliated prey but the dietary niches of these hydromedusan species centered on different fractions of the available plankton. Consequently, little dietary overlap occurred between the ambush foraging hydromedusae. In contrast, the dietary niches of cruising predators (Aequorea victoria, Mitrocoma cellularia, and Phialidium gregarium) overlapped substantially because those species all fed on similar soft-bodied prey such as eggs and appendicularians. These results have two important implications for trophic patterns involving medusae. First, different mechanisms of prey encounter and capture used by hydromedusae (ambush vs. cruising patterns) result in important interspecific dietary differences and, hence, trophic roles of the medusae. Second, whereas cruising medusae may consume similar prey and hence form a feeding guild, ambush-foraging medusae may experience substantially less prey overlap and, for the community examined here, do not experience potentially strong feeding competition from other medusan species.",2002,934-942,,4,47,,,,,,,,,"Costello, J.

Forty defended nests were observed (27 with eggs); 77% of these involved red algae with Gelidium nudifrons (56%) the principal species. The male's courtship repertoire includes five behavioral units and a distinctive nuptial body color pattern. The female is passive throughout. The female deposits a mass of adhesive eggs within the nest following a short courtship by the male. Spawning requires 40 to over 60 min to complete. In addition to fertilizing the eggs, the male chases intruding fishes from the area while the female is in the nest. The egg mass was apparently the result of a single spawning, because no nests were observed with multiple stages of egg development. The male guards the eggs after the spent female leaves.

To examine the extent to which tidepool habitat is segregated by the 5 fishes, habitat partitioning patterns among and within the species were determined at 2 sites in San Diego. Fish density, species composition, and fish size were measured in 105 tidepools every 3 mo from November 1996 to August 1997. Hypotheses were tested pertaining to the segregation of habitat among different species and different size classes within species relative to the tidepool characteristics of intertidal height, surface area, depth, rugosity, and percent algal cover. A manipulative field experiment was conducted to further investigate these results. Tidepools were partitioned among and within fish species. Tidepool characteristics most important in partitioning were intertidal height, depth, and rugosity, with the order of importance of these characteristics different for each species. Habitat partitioning between size classes within species, although not as great as partitioning among species, was also based largely on tidepool intertidal height and rugosity. Although fish abundance changed seasonally, species' distribution patterns, with the exception of C. analis, were seasonally stable. The seasonal change in C. analis distribution was due to the arrival of new recruits rather than a seasonal change in adult habitat. The use of different types of tidepools by different species and by different size classes within species serves to limit contact among these groups, and therefore both direct and indirect competition, during low tide.",2000,253-268,,,196,,Mar Ecol Prog Ser,,,,,,,"Davis, J.

It is then relevant to consider the factors which control local diversity during succession. In offshore kelp forests across the whole Southern Californian Bight settlement panels were rapidly colonised by two species of cyclostome bryozoans (Tubulipora tuba and T. pacifica); but cheilostome bryozoans eventually became dominant during succession because they were able to grow over Tubulipora spp. When abundant, Tubulipora spp. were apparently able to reduce the number of colonies, and hence the number of species, of cheilostome bryozoans settling on the panels. Thus the rapid colonisers may delay the process of succession and reduce the diversity of bryozoans during succession. In field and laboratory experiments we found that the asteroid Patiria miniata preys on Tubulipora spp. but not on cheilostome bryozoans. The predator speeds up the successional process and increases bryozoan diversity by reducing the cover of Tubulipora spp. Other ways in which predators may influence diversity during succession are discussed.

In this system, urchins (often considered the most voracious herbivores exerting top-down control on kelp beds) tend to remain sedentary because of the high availability of detrital macroalgae, but the extent to which kelp crabs consume kelp (and other food options) is largely unknown. I conducted four types of laboratory feeding experiments to evaluate kelp crab feeding patterns: (1) feeding electivity between bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) and seven species of co-occurring local macroalgae; (2) feeding electivity on aged vs. fresh bull kelp; (3) feeding preference between N. luetkeana and small snails (Lacuna sp.); and (4) scaling of feeding rate with body size in P. producta and P. gracilis. In choice experiments, P. producta consumed greater mass of N. luetkeana than of other macroalgal species offered and elected to eat fresh bull kelp over aged. However, P. producta also consumed snails (Lacuna sp.), indicating more generalized feeding than previously suspected. Feeding rates for P. producta exceeded the expected 3∕4 scaling rule of metabolic rates, indicating that larger P. producta may have a disproportionately large impact on bull kelp. A subtidal field experiment, designed to assess the influence of consumers on juvenile bull kelp net tissue gain, found that only fully enclosed (protected) bull kelp increased in wet mass and blade length. Herbivory by kelp crabs, among other consumers, is likely to play a previously unrecognized role in mediating the growth and survival of this annual kelp species within the Salish Sea.",5/25/17,e3372,,,5,,PeerJ,,,,,,,"Dobkowski, K.

In the first set of experiments, snails of five treatment groups were presented over a 10-week period to one of three predators: sunflower stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides Brandt), red rock crabs (Cancer productus Randall), and kelp-greenling fish (Hexagrammus decagrammus Pallas). The five treatment groups were: snails with all varices removed, snails with one only of the right, middle, or left varix removed, and snails with all varices intact. The kelp-greenling fish ate no snails and were discarded from subsequent experiments. Seastars consumed significantly more snails with all varices removed than any of the other treatment groups. Crabs ate significantly more snails with all varices- and right varix-removed compared with the other three groups. Thus, snails with all varices intact were less likely to be eaten by either crab or seastar predators. Scoring the shells of Ceratostoma, but leaving the varices intact had no effect on consumption rates by either seastars or crabs. In a second set of experiments, the smooth-shelled Nucella lamellosa (Gmelin) was presented as a food item along with Ceratostoma with all varices removed and Ceratostoma with all varices intact for an 8-week period. Seastars clearly preferred the smooth-shelled Nucella over the other two groups. In contrast, crabs ate Ceratostoma with all varices removed at a greater rate than control Ceratostoma and Nucella. Energy content of dry flesh of the two snail species was almost identical, suggesting that other factors were involved in governing selection of one prey species over the other. In both sets of experiments, ingestive conditioning learning was not apparent for either the seastars or the crabs. Crabs were videotaped while feeding on Ceratostoma with all, one only, or no varices removed. The videotapes revealed that a combination of chipping the shell around the aperture with the chelipeds, then snapping it in half, was the method most often used to gain access to the soft parts of the shell. However, snails with all varices removed were more often snapped in two without any preliminary chipping, presumably because the lack of varices made them easier to break apart. There was no relationship between snail treatment and the time it took to break into the shell.",4/1/99,235-251,,2,236,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,Functional significance of shell sculpture in gastropod molluscs,,,,,,"Donovan, D.

The ophiuroid strongly preferred reduced light and to a lesser extent complex substrata. Further, displacement speed increased with light intensity and decreased with substratum complexity (ophiuroids were virtually immobile on darkened complex substrata). In the field, the density of exposed ophiuroids, with the disk out of a crevice, was always low, irrespective of the intensity of solar radiation. However, the extent to which they extended their arms (to feed) was inversely related to light intensity, as the number of suspension-feeding arms was low under direct sunlight, intermediate under indirect light and high at night. Field observations showed that the response to light was not modified when UV radiation was eliminated with a filter, and a laboratory experiment showed that white light intensity alone produced patterns similar to those observed in the field. O. aculeata may reduce arm extension with increasing light intensity to reduce the threat of visual predators, whose foraging efficiency increases with light intensity. However, visual predators are rare in our study site. We hypothesize that the large-scale larval dispersion of O. aculeata (due to the long pelagic phase) prevents ophiuroids from adapting to local conditions so that its response to light reflects adaptation to visual predators in other locations.",12/15/04,139-154,,1,313,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,,,,,,"Drolet, D., Himmelman, J.

Field and laboratory experiments showed that the use of crevices by ophiuroids tended to reduce predation by urchins. The ophiuroids’ response to contact with the urchin was to retract deeper into crevices. In contrast, in the laboratory, the ophiuroids’ vulnerability to the sea star was higher on complex substrata. In the laboratory, ophiuroids reacted weakly to contact with the arm tip or ambulacral groove of A. vulgaris, but immediately fled refuges when there was contact with the sea star’s stomach. In the field, the density of ophiuroids in 20 cm diameter circular plots placed around sea stars (both feeding and non-feeding) was similar to that in areas without sea stars. However, the estimated density of ophiuroids directly under sea stars was less than in areas without sea stars, and exposed ophiuroids (with the disk outside a crevice) were more abundant near A. vulgaris than in areas without sea stars: both differences were greater when the sea star was feeding. Ophiuroids display risk sensitivity adjusted to the 2 predators. They mainly flee crevices under a sea star when there is contact with the sea star’s stomach, but only move a few centimeters.

The cells comprising the cyst are contributed by the ascidian. The cells are columnar, contain large central reservoirs of glycogen and lipid, and have a conspicuous Golgi apparatus, many small cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and peripheral mitochondria. The cells are held together by complex basal interdigitations and a short apical zonula occludens. Long cilia emerge in circular clusters from the cell apices and beat in the lumen of the cyst. As atypical of a columnar epithelial layer, the nuclei are staggered in position in the cells and there is no basal lamina. One end of the cyst is blind, but the other end, which may be either anterior or posterior with respect to the longitudinal axis of the host, narrows to a profusely ciliated duct which opens through the wall of the blood vessel to the atrium of the ascidian by a ciliated funnel. The effective beat of the cilia of the duct and the funnel is outward toward the atrium. The first nauplii of the copepod emerge from the incubatory pouch of the adult and pass to the exterior sea water through the cyst funnel and the atrium and atrial siphon of the ascidian. As in other notodelphyid copepods, the life cycle of this incarcerated form also involves free-living naupliar stages followed by two free-living copepodid stages. The provision of an egress for the first nauplii is, therefore, important to the survival of the species. The adult females of Scolecodes, which range in length from 2 to 14.6 mm, are sluggish when removed from the cyst and fail to survive in sea water for more than 24 hours. The males, which have only been obtained when parasitic fifth copepodids molt in culture, are much smaller, averaging 0.8 mm, and are very active. Since one dead male has been found inside the cyst of an adult female and females are often found with attached spermatophores, it is suggested that the funnel of the cyst may also serve as an entrance for the males. Evidence is presented for the formation of the cyst as an accumulation of totipotent lymphocytes around the copepod. Cysts of parasitic developmental stages (third through fifth copepodids) are also described. All of these cysts and those of immature adult females lack funnels to the atrium. The funnel of the cyst of mature females is formed, in part, by modified cells of the wall of the blood vessel, but is induced after the major portion of the cellular cyst has been formed. Cells in the general circulation of the ascidian and those inside the lumen of the cyst are compared. The cells in the lumen of the mature cyst do not arise by diapedesis of blood cells from the subendostylar blood vessel, but by conversion and migration of cells composing the cyst proper. These cells have been found in the guts of the copepods and they may serve as a nutritive source. The ascidian appears not to be harmed by the association, but the copepod gains in many ways.",1968,263-281,,3,124,,,,,,,,,"Dudley, P. L. (1968).

We find that the native Aleut people played distinctive roles as super-generalist and highly-omnivorous consumers closely connected to other species. Although the human population was positioned to have strong effects, arrival and presence of Aleut people in the Sanak Archipelago does not appear associated with long-term extinctions. We simulated food web dynamics to explore to what degree introducing a species with trophic roles like those of an Aleut forager, and allowing for variable strong feeding to reflect use of hunting technology, is likely to trigger extinctions. Potential extinctions decreased when an invading omnivorous super-generalist consumer focused strong feeding on decreasing fractions of its possible resources.

Abundances and positions of fishes within four vertically oriented zones were observed during 42 paired day and night scuba transects made throughout the year along a line secured to a high-relief rocky reef located about 1.6 km offshore. Feeding activity was determined for surfperches (Embiotocidae) from the proportion of fish collected during the day or night having empty ""foreguts;' and inferred for other fishes from general observations of individuals. Although almost all of the 25 common fish species recorded were seen both day and .night, the number seen and the degree of activity of most of these species decreas~d considerably at night. Many fishes that fed and moved about in mid-water well above the reef during the day were found in holes and crevices in the reef at night; others that foraged on or just above the bottom during the day showed little change in their position; and still others tended to disperse to adjacent areas of the reef. Daytime aggregations of fishes centered around the crest of the reef and other productive prominences and invariably dispersed at night. Unlike tropical communities of reef fishes, the kelp-bed community included neither a broad replacement for diurnal planktivores in the night shift nor a contingent that moves out over nearby sand flats to forage at night. Kelp-bed fishes showed considerable intraspecific variability in behavior. Thus; the kelp-bed community appears to be more loosely ""programmed"" even though it follows the same basic pattern of diel activity as the tropical-reef community. The kelp-bed species that belong to primarily tropical families tended to be quite specialized in their nocturnal sheltering behavior. Yet the primarily temperate surfperches, for example, simply became somewhat lethargic and remained exposed at night.",1976,,,,74,,,,,,,,,"Ebeling, A. W., & Bray, R. N. (1976).

Effects of avian predation on highly mobile predators such as crabs, remains practically unstudied in rocky shore ecosystems. The crab, Cancer borealis, is an important component of the diet of gulls (Larus marinus, L. argentatus) at the Isles of Shoals, Maine, USA. C. borealis prey include the predatory gastropod Nucella lapillus L., the herbivore Littorina littorea, and mussels Mytilus edulis L. We hypothesized that gulls reduce abundance of C. borealis in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal, thereby allowing C. borealis prey to persist in high numbers. A study of crab tidal migration showed that C. borealis density nearly doubled at high tide compared to low tide; thus, crabs from a large subtidal source population migrate into the intertidal zone during high tides and either emigrate or are removed by gulls during low tides. Results from a small-scale (1 m2) predator caging experiment in the low intertidal zone indicated that enclosed crabs signiﬁcantly reduced L. littorea abundance when protected from gull predation. In a much larger-scale gull exclusion experiment, densities of C. borealis increased signiﬁcantly during low and high tides in exclosures relative to the controls. C. borealis density was inversely correlated with changes in the abundance of two mesopredators Carcinus maenas and Nucella lapillus, and with the space-occupier M. edulis. There was a similar negative correlation between abundance of C. borealis and the change in abundance of the herbivore L. littorea, but the trend was not signiﬁcant. Mortality of tethered L. littorea was associated with C. borealis density across sites. However, preferred algae did not change in response to L. littorea density during the experiment. Thus, we found suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence for a three-level cascade involving gulls, crabs, and L. littorea. Our studies strongly suggest that gulls, as apex predators, generate three-level trophic cascades in rocky intertidal food webs by preventing the highly mobile subtidal predator, C. borealis, from establishing substantial populations in the low-mid intertidal zone thereby indirectly enhancing densities of two key mesopredators (N. lapillus, Carcinus) and blue mussels (M. edulis).",2007-04,853-863,,4,88,,Ecology,,,,,,,"Ellis, J.

Their density is generally greatest in the upper and mid—intertidal zones on rocky shores of the Pacific coastal of North America, and least in the low intertidal zone. However, the elevation of the lower limits of their shore—level distribution varies considerably among sites. In addition, the lower limits are generally higher south of central California than in the north, and the average body size is usually smaller in the south than farther north. This is exemplified by the commonest molluscan grazer in the mid—intertidal region of many rocky shores on this coast, the trochid snail Tegula funebralis. A hypothesis to explain these patterns, that they are due to variation in predation, was tested. At sites where predator density was high, regardless of latitude, the lower limit of Tegula's intertidal range was higher on the shore, compared with areas containing few predators. Shell width was usually smaller, and increased with elevation wherever predators were abundant. Predators were more abundant at southern than at northern sites. The primary predators of Tegula are octopuses (Octopus bimaculoides and O. bimaculatus), the starfish Pisaster ochraceus, and crabs of the genus Cancer. The octopuses occur only at the southern sites, whereas Pisaster and Cancer are found throughout the geographic range of the study. Reciprocal transplants of marked Tegula, done between several southern and northern sites, showed that the lower limit of distribution of adult Tegula on the shore at a given site is influenced by the snails' defensive behavior. Where predators were abundant, both southern and northern Tegula placed low on the shore rapidly climbed to higher levels than in locations where predators were scarce. The probable cause of this upward migration is an avoidance response to chemical exudates from predators. Southern Tegula also have an inherently different response than northern Tegula; southern snails always climbed upwards sooner and reached higher levels than northern snails. This resulted in predators killing more of the northern snails in these experiments. The behavioral difference between southern and northern Tegula may be the result of long—term differences in the intensity of predation by octopuses, which are much rarer in the intertidal north of central California than south of there. Young—of—the—year Tegula were found mainly in the mid—intertidal region. The shift in the direction of shore—level size gradients of Tegula populations between high and low predation sites may be caused by movements of adult snails to levels above or below the less mobile juveniles. The relative scarcity of Tegula and other grazing molluscs in the low intertidal zone is probably due both to upward migration and high mortality rates, with predation being a major cause of both.",1984,1214-1230,,4,65,,,,,,,,,"Fawcett, M.

Sharks are generally presumed to be highly visual predators; thus, it is reasonable to expect that they might also be capable of such behavioral modulation. In this study, I investigated the effect of prey item size and type on prey-capture behavior in leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) that had been acclimated to feeding in the laboratory. Using high-speed video, sharks were filmed feeding on two sizes of the same prey item (thawed shrimp pieces) and two potentially more elusive prey items (live earthworms and live mud shrimp). In leopard sharks, little effect of prey elusivity was found for kinematic variables during prey capture. However, the large proportion of successful captures of the live prey suggests that they did not prove to be truly elusive prey items for the leopard shark. There were significant size effects on prey-capture kinematics, with the larger non-elusive items inducing greater head expansion during prey capture. Ram–suction index values also indicated that strikes on large, non-elusive prey had a significantly larger suction component than strikes on similar small prey items. This finding is interesting given that the two sizes of non-elusive prey item offered no differential challenge in terms of a performance consequence (reduced capture success).",8/15/98,2433-2444,,16,201,,Journal of Experimental Biology,,,,,,,"Ferry-Graham, L.

During the laboratory culture of the California mud-fiat oetopus. Octopus bimaculoides(Pickford & McConnaughey, 1949), concurrent infestations of ectoparasitic flagellate and ciliate protozoans were discovered when examining sick and dying animals. The flagellates, similar to the bodonid parasite, Ichthyobodo necator (Henneguy, 1883), were small (3–9 μm total length) and infested any surface epithelia exposed to sea water. The larger ciliates (l5–30 μm total length), believed to be ancistrocomids, were found only on the gills. This is the first documented report of ciliate or flagellate ecto-parasites infesting cephalopod molluscs. Flagellate infestations were first manifest on the dorsal arms and mantle surfaces of O. bimaculoides as white spots visible when the octopuses were in dark colouration. Lesions formed at the centres of the spots and the interspersed lesions eventually connected. Once the parasites damaged the epidermis, secondary bacterial infections caused lesioning. Both parasites heavily infested the gills. Clinical signs first appeared at 2 months post-hatching (0-5 g). Octopuses seemed to become refractory to the disease beyond a size of 25 g. No effective treatment was found for these infestations. It was possible to eliminate parasite spread in the laboratory by prefiltering water to l μm.

The birds exert a major influence on the microdistribution of these molluscs. Where accessible to oystercatcher predation, limpets are unlikely to survive over a winter once they reach moderate size (10—14 mm). Collisella pelta are exceptional in having refuge in large size. Oystercatchers thus produce and reinforce patchy limpet distributions. Adaptations of the limpets include crypsis and habitat selection of setting larvae. Spatial heterogeneity on local, regional, and broader geographic scales complicates these effects, especially since settlement behavior is constrained from making distinctions between all levels of heterogeneity, e.g., between cliffs where limpets will be relatively safe and boulders where they are at high risk. Locally the effects of bird predation are most notable for Notoacmea persona, but N. scutum, C. digitalis, and C. pelta are also consumed in significant numbers. The resulting microdistribution of limpets affects algal cover, which tends to be effectively removed by their grazing on steep and vertical walls, but which can maintain itself on large horizontal and gently sloping surfaces. Feeding in this locale was confined to the birds' nonbreeding season, fall and winter. By its end the limpets were reduced in number and the birds foraged elsewhere and on other prey.

Both seastars have the same preferred prey, the mussel Mytilus edulis, select medium-sized mussels (1.5–3.0 cm), and show similar responses to increasing mussel density (functional response). Differences between the two seastars in their feeding abilities appear to affect both their size selection of mussels and use of alternative prey when mussels become rare or absent. A. vulgaris selects larger mussels than L. polaris when mussel abundance is low, and this may optimize its energetic intake. L. polaris is be better able to prey on the crevice-dwelling clam Hiatella arctica and A. vulgaris on the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata. These differences in prey selection may reduce potential competitive interactions between the two seastars, as they cause prey partitioning when the preferred prey is rare or absent.

After observing the kelp forests of Tierra del Fuego, Charles Darwin (1860, p. 227-229) wrote: ""There is one marine production, which from its importance is worthy of a particular history. It is the kelp, or Macrocystis pyrifera…The number of living creatures of all Orders, whose existence intimately depends on the kelp, is wonderful…I can only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere, with the terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions. Yet if in any country a forest was destroyed, I do not believe nearly so many species of animals would perish as would here, from the destruction of the kelp.""Along the coast of California, forests of giant kelp also harbor rich and complex communities of marine plants and animals. The environmental conditions and species composition of these forests vary, but they all have one factor in common: the dominating presence of the giant kelp, Macrocystis sp. In what ways are the organisms associated with this plant influenced by it and dependent on it?Macrocystis plays a major role in determining the physical structure of the kelp forest community. It not only substantially increases the total substrate area (Clendenning, 1960, in North, 1971a), but also extends that substrate vertically through the water column to the sea surface. The morphological heterogeneity of the plant itself provides a diversity of habitats (North, 197la; Pearse and Gerard, in press). The influence of Macrocystis on the physical structure of the forest is comparable to that of the trees in a terrestrial forest and of the hermatypic corals in a tropical reef community.Macrocystis also influences the trophic structure of the forest community as the dominant primary producer, outweighing and outproducing the other benthic algae and phytoplankton (Clendenning, 1971; North, 197la). The magnitude and fate of the kelp production and its role as a food base within the forest community are the major concerns of this thesis.In the first chapter, I investigate the dynamics of the attached kelp population, and examine the magnitude and mechanisms of drift kelp production and its importance, relative to grazing and detritus formation, as a pathway of primary production within and out of the kelp forest. The formation of drift kelp influences the availability of kelp production to and its utilization by members of the forest community. This trophic pathway is discussed in the second chapter, in which I consider benthic drift plant material as a resource within the forest. Finally, in the third chapter, I test my hypotheses on the role of benthic drift algae and seagrasses as a trophic pathway by study­ing the feeding habits of the drift consumer, Patiria miniata. The dependence of this asteroid on the drift plant resource may provide insight into the dependence of other kelp forest inhabitants on the productivity of Macrocystis.",12/1/76,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gerard, V.

The daily predation impact on the total standing stock of small copepods varied seasonally between 6% in spring and 0.4% in winter. This percentage may represent a negligible impact on the entire copepod community, but it is relevant at the species or genus level, since S. enflata removed more than 20% of the standing stock of Centropages brachiatus and Corycaeus sp.

Marine snails of the genus Caledoniella (Caledoniellidae) are obligate parasites that live on the abdominal surface of the gonodactylid mantis shrimps. They have highly modified morphological characteristics specialized to the ectoparasitic lifestyle that make it difficult to infer their close relatives, thereby posing a question about their current systematic position in the superfamily Vanikoroidea. In the present study, we performed molecular phylogenetic analyses using three nuclear and three mitochondrial gene sequences to unveil the phylogenetic position of these enigmatic snails. The resulting trees recovered Caledoniella in the superfamily Truncatelloidea and within a subclade of commensal species that live on the burrow wall of marine benthic invertebrates. More specifically, Caledoniella formed the sister clade to a commensal snail species living in mantis-shrimp burrows and they collectively were sister to Sigaretornus planus (formerly in the family Tornidae or Vitrinellidae), a commensal living in echiuran burrows. This topology suggests that the species of Caledoniella achieved their ectoparasitic mode of life through the following evolutionary pathway: (1) invasion into the burrows of benthic invertebrates, (2) specialization to mantis shrimps, and (3) colonization of the host body surface from the host burrow wall with the evolution of the parasitic nature. The final step is likely to have been accompanied by the acquisition of a sucker on the metapodium, the loss of the radula and operculum, and the formation of monogamous pair bonds. The present molecular phylogeny also suggested parallel evolution of planispiral shells in a subclade of Truncatelloidea and enabled us to newly redefine the families Caledoniellidae, Elachisinidae, Teinostomatidae, Tornidae and Vitrinellidae.",10/1/21,107122,,,163,,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,Snails riding mantis shrimps,,,,,,"Goto, R., Takano, T., Eernisse, D.

However, the extent to which juveniles are susceptible to predators is unknown for most species, and it remains unclear to what extent ontogenetic shifts in susceptibility to predators are common among marine invertebrates. This study examined the northern abalone Haliotis kamtschatkana, a species listed as threatened in British Columbia, Canada. Our goals were to characterize the diversity and abundance of species that prey on juvenile abalone and determine if abalone experience an ontogenetic shift in susceptibility to predators. Juvenile H. kamtschatkana were found to be susceptible to a broad variety of predators: 14 of the 37 potential predator species to which we offered juvenile abalone (≤28 mm shell length (SL)) consumed at least one juvenile abalone. Four of those species (three crabs and one seastar) consumed ≥10% of the juvenile abalone that were offered in the laboratory. These species were present at field sites where abalone are found, indicating that they have the potential to be significant predators of juvenile H. kamtschatkana in the wild. The most abundant predators were small crabs, especially Lophopanopeus bellus (black-clawed crabs) and Scyra acutifrons (sharp-nosed crabs). Juvenile H. kamtschatkana also experienced a pronounced ontogenetic shift in susceptibility to predators. The risk of predation for juvenile H. kamtschatkana decreased rapidly with increasing body size, especially over the 12–13 mm SL size range. Susceptibility remained low beyond 13 mm SL, indicating relatively low and unchanging levels of predation risk once the individual reaches this size. Although abalone are susceptible to several species during the first 1–2 years of life, predator effects on juvenile abalone abundance and microhabitat use may largely be attributable to the influence of only 1 or 2 predator species that can only kill abalone <13 mm SL.",6/6/08,85-93,,2,360,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,,,,,,"Griffiths, A.

Data from a previous study indicated that productivity was the best predictor of several assemblage characteristics; hence, food resources may have been limiting in this assemblage. To determine whether food resource partitioning was a potential organizational mechanism for this assemblage, the following aspects of trophic organization were quantified for 1,858 individuals of 16 species, collected over a 31‐month period: (1) annual, seasonal, and size‐related dietary changes, (2) annual and seasonal patterns of interspecific dietary overlap, (3) delineation of the relationship between morphological similarity and dietary similarity and (4) estimates of annual prey consumption rates by fish predators.                            Fishes were classified into seven basic feeding groups: crab feeders, crab‐shrimp feeders, shrimp‐hermit crab feeders, polychaete‐shrimp feeders,               Idotea               feeders, algal‐sea anemone feeders, and gammarid feeders. Major prey taxa consumed by these groups were:               Cancer               spp.,               Pugettia producta, Heptacarpus taylori, Pagurus hemphilli, Idotea               spp.,               Anthopleura               spp.,               Viva               spp.,               Porphyra               spp., gammarids and polychaetes. Based on dietary breadth estimates using Levins' index (Levins, 1968), species possessed either narrow (1 08‐2‐30) or wide (7–62‐9‐71) dietary niches, with only one species displaying an intermediate value. High values were obtained for estimates of intraspecific dietary overlap between seasons (x̄± IS.D. = 0–678 ± 0–197) and among years (x̄± IS.D. = 0–634 ± 0178). Hence, species generally exhibited stable patterns of food resource utilization. Many fishes showed size‐related dietary changes. These generally represented switches from smaller (e.g. gammarids) to larger (e.g. crabs, shrimp, polychaetes) prey.                          Interspecific dietary overlap was very low and averaged 0–275 ± 0–255 for all pairwise comparisons. Nine of 12 species did not display seasonal differences in interspecific dietary overlap, and the three remaining species exhibited lower overlap during the season of lowest productivity. There was a significantly greater number of low overlap values (i.e. < 0–400) than could be expected by chance alone. In addition, species which displayed the lowest amount of dietary overlap were those for which food limitation was probably most severe (i.e. resident‐resident overlaps < resident‐seasonal overlaps < seasonal‐seasonal overlaps). These data indicate that food resource partitioning probably was operating within this assemblage. This mechanism is the most likely process responsible for assemblage organization because predators, competition for space and environmental disturbances do not seem to have a strong effect on this assemblage.             Morphological and dietary similarity were assessed by conducting a multivariate analysis on nine variables associated with prey capture: standard length, head length, head height, jaw length, jaw width, mouth protrusibility, mouth orientation, eye position and the number of gill rakers on the first gill arch. A principal component analysis of these data extracted two components which accounted for 84% of the variance and indicated that species comprised morphologically distinct groups. The first principal component was a general size‐related component, and the second was a trophically linked component on which mouth orientation, eye position and the number of gill rakers loaded most heavily. MANOVA indicated that significant differences existed among species' morphologies and a discriminant function analysis (DFA) correctly assigned individuals to species 96% of the time. To test the ecomorphological hypothesis, Mahalanobis distances derived from the DFA were regressed against interspecific dietary overlap. None of ten regressions, representing all possible combinations of residency pattern and season, yielded correlations which were significantly different from zero. These results are discordant with the predictions of the ecomorphological hypothesis and suggest that behaviour is more important than morphology in determining prey utilization.             Estimates of prey consumption rates were quantified by deriving an estimate of the mean number of each prey species consumed per day by each fish species. Annual consumption rates summed over all predators for various prey species ranged from 625 to 13,826 individuals consumed per year in the 19 m by 30 m study site. These data indicate that fish predation may exert a strong selective pressure on intertidal invertebrates.             The Dillon Beach rocky intertidal fish assemblage was organized through deterministic processes (i.e. food resource partitioning) over a 42‐month period. This mechanism is different from the organizational mechanism exhibited by intertidal algal and invertebrate assemblages which are primarily affected by stochastic forces. The evolutionary forces responsible for assemblage organization affect different taxa in different ways; hence, habitat‐wide extrapolations regarding community organization are probably unwise.",1986-02,317-355,,2,1,,Journal of Zoology,,,,,,,"Grossman, G.

The defensive mechanisms shown by the west coast, intertidal sea anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima, in response to its nudibranch predator Aeolidia papillosa are identified and evaluated in the context of the environment where A. elegantissima occurs. The defensive mechanisms include intertidal distribution, clone formation, alarm response, bulging of the column, crawling and releasing from the substrate.2. A. papillosa are primarily located at the periphery of clones so that anemones in the interior of the clone have a refuge from predation. Assuming that cloning is an adaptation for space competition in A. elegantissima, then the additional advantage derived as a defensive mechanism should increase selection for clone formation.3. A. papillosa was less able than A. elegantissima to withstand desiccation from exposure at low tide. This suggests that the intertidal distribution of A. elegantissima is a defensive adaptation which reduces the threat of predation by A. papillosa at least during the warmer months of the year.4. The bulging of the column at the site of contact was found to be a localized response of several hours duration. The mucus of A. papillosa stimulated the response and the receptors were found to be situated in the column. Mucus from the coelenterate-eating aeolid nudibranch, Hermissenda crassicornis, also initiated the response while neither the mucus from the sponge eating dorid, Anisodoris nobilis, nor control swabs dipped in sea water caused bulging.5. None of the defensive mechanism directly protects an anemone from attack by A. papillosa. The defensive mechanisms all interact to minimize damage to the clone until the predator is removed by desiccation and or wave action. This strategy is most effective during the 2-to 3-month period between when the veliger metamorphoses and when the nudibranch reaches sexual maturity.6. This defensive strategy of killing the young nudibranch before it reproduces may negatively influence prey selection by the veliger stage. The evolution of the prey preference hierarchy of the veliger stage should be based on the criterion of survival to sexual maturity. Evidence for the effectiveness of this defensive strategy is that Aeolidia papillosa is primarily associated with the subtidal anemone, Metridium senile, one of the least preferred prey of adult nudibranchs.",1979-08,138-152,,1,157,,,,,,,,,"Harris, L.

Three nudibranch species characteristically graze Dendrobeania lichenoides colony perimeters and leave the center unconsumed: @?50% of surveyed colonies showed evidence of nudibranch predation. The proportion of a colony consumed is density dependent. When prey density was low, nudibranchs could consumed entire colonies, but ate less per colony as prey density increased in laboratory experiments. Nudibranchs apparently assess intracolonial variations in quality, and when prey are abundant, select the preferred parts (perimeter) of each colony. In paired palatability tests, nudibranchs rejected strips cut from colony centers, yet readily ate pieces from other regions. Three features of the colonies were associated with the nonpalatable center of the colony: attachment rhizoids, brown bodies, and embryo. The attachment rhizoids do not account for the decreased palatability observed, which thus may result from either distasteful embryos of brown bodies, which both occur in highest numbers in the colony center. Brown bodies are products of degenerated polypides retained within zooecia in some bryozoan taxa. The function of brown body retention has never been established, despite considerable debate among invertebrate biologists. This study indicates that colonial invertebrate colonies are not necessarily homogeneous resources. Intracolonial palatability may generally vary with ontogeny which, in a colonial animal (or plant) results in intracolonial variation.

However, M. pupillus are almost never utilized as a host by Crepidula adunca. We examined the reasons for host fidelity by Crepidula adunca in the San Juan Islands. The small but voracious sea star Leptasterias hexactis was common across all our intertidal survey sites and consumed significantly more M. pupillus than Calliostoma ligatum in laboratory experiments. Individuals of Calliostoma ligatum stimulated by tube feet from Leptasterias hexactis moved significantly more quickly than non-stimulated individuals, but snails of this species stimulated by Pycnopodia helianthoides did not move at a significantly different rate than non-stimulated snails. There was a significant positive correlation between gastropod size and the rate of movement for Calliostoma ligatum stimulated by Leptasterias hexactis, but this correlation was not significant for non-stimulated individuals. Neither stimulation by asteroids nor gastropod size (whether for stimulated or non-stimulated snails) had a significant effect on the rate of movement for M. pupillus. Thus Calliostoma ligatum, and especially large individuals of this species, react more than M. pupillus to the presence of a common predator (Leptasterias hexactis) in such a way that likely elevates the snails' chance of escape. Finally, we found that Calliostoma ligatum used both chemical and physical defenses to effectively repel attacks by Leptasterias hexactis, while defenses by M. pupillus were less successful. We suggest that epibiotic Crepidula adunca specialize on Calliostoma ligatum in the San Juan Islands because this particular host species is more likely to protect the epibiont from shared doom due to its effective defenses against potential predators.",9/30/11,79-86,,1,406,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,,,,,,"Herstoff, E.

Mature female leopard sharks have been observed aggregating in shallow embayments throughout California; however, it is unclear why only females aggregate in these shallow areas. The goal of this study was to determine if mature female leopard sharks selectively occupy the warmest areas of a shallow embayment, if free-ranging leopard sharks' body temperatures are significantly warmer during the day than at night, and to quantify temporal use of these shallow habitats. Visual observations of sharks' fine-scale movements within the shallows of Big Fisherman's Cove Marine Life Refuge (Santa Catalina Island) aggregation site indicated that sharks preferred the warmest areas of the embayment and moved to warmer locations over the course of the day (p<0.05). Active and passive acoustic tracking, along with archival transponder technology (Vemco: V13, V13-R256, VX32TP-CHAT tags respectively) of 16 sharks caught and tagged within this aggregation were used to monitor core body temperature, swimming depth, and movements. Sharks had significantly higher core body temperatures in the late afternoon (1700 h–2000 h) during the summer, showed increased fidelity to thermal refuges during the day and increased movement away from these refuges at night (χ2, p<0.05).

The distribution of the five species showed zones of peak abundances along a transect from the intertidal zone through the kelp forest to a deep reef. P. richii was the most abundant species with peak densities of 6 crabs/m2 at the middle and inner edge of the kelp forest. M. foliatus was second most abundant with a peak of 3.5 crabs/m2 at the middle and outer edge of the kelp forest. S. acutifrons had peak densities of about 3 crabs/m2 at the outer edge of the kelp forest. P. producta had a peak of 2 crabs/m2 in the intertidal zone. L. crispatus was present in low densities of about 0.5 crabs/m2 from the middle of the kelp forest to the deep reef. The greatest combined density of spider crabs (11 crabs/m2) occurred at the middle of the kelp forest. Densities of all five species in the main study area in the middle of the kelp forest showed a synchronous cycle with a maximum in late summer and fall and a decline in winter to a low in spring. The cycle appeared to be caused by a combination of density—independent mortality from winter swells and storm activity and by slower development and growth rates during the upwelling period of colder water temperatures. Brooding frequencies of all the species remained high year—round. Size structures of the populations did not change during bimonthly sampling, indicating continuous recruitment. Size—frequency analysis of crab populations along the transect indicated that juveniles of Pugettia producta recruit into the intertidal and shallow Phyllospadix zones and migrate out into the kelp forest as they grow, but the other species did not have zones of recruitment separate from adult distribution. The diversity of predators which take spider crabs as a major portion of their diets indicated that the general level of predation pressure is high and may limit the overall population levels of the crabs. Predation by sea otters probably limits the density of P. producta, and the other four species are probably limited by fish predation. The crabs exhibit different color morphs, color change, and decorating behavior, which are adaptive for concealment from predators. Size at maturity of the five species spanned an order of magnitude in carapace width from small Scyra acutifrons (1 cm) to large Loxorhynchus crispatus (10 cm). Mean body size of mature females and mean body size of the entire population of all pairs of species except Mimulus foliatus/Pugettia richii had ratios larger than Hutchinson's (1959) predicted value of 1.28. Body size may reflect limitations of the crabs' utilization of crevice refuges in the microhabitat. Partitioning of the microhabitat resource was measured by substrate utilization. Mimulus foliatus had the largest microhabitat niche breadth and was found on most types of substrates, with an important refuge in kelp holdfasts. Pugettia richii was found primarily on the alga Cystoseira osmundacea and in coralline algal mats. Scyra acutifrons occurred in the interstices of algal/invertebrate turf, and Loxorhynchus crispatus was found on top of the turf. Pugettia producta occurred upon the kelp plants and had the narrowest microhabitat niche breadth. Analysis of stomach contents showed partitioning of food resources. Pugettia producta was a strict specialist grazing on giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera. Mimulus foliatus and Pugettia richii also had narrow diets of mostly drift M. pyrifera. Scyra acutifrons had major food categories of detritus, sponge, and pieces of M. pyrifera trapped in the algal—invertebrate turf. Loxorhynchus crispatus was a dietary generalist foraging on a broad range of invertebrates and giant kelp. Niche separation in the guild is multidimensional, and similar utilization of one resource is generally complemented by dissimilar utilization of another resource. Graphical analysis of niche separation for the three dimensions of microhabitat, food, and body size showed that Pugettia producta is an overall specialist and Loxorhynchus crispatus is a generalist. Scyra acutifrons also has a distinct niche within the algal invertebrate turf, but Mimulus foliatus and Pugettia richii exhibit extensive overlap in all of the parameters measured. However, the degree to which a species is a specialist vs. a generalist for a resource did not relate to the amount of niche overlap with the rest of the guild. Microhabitat resources appear to be the most important for niche separation and may also be explained as adaptations for minimizing predation.",1982,179-198,,2,52,,,Coexistence in a Kelp Forest,,,,,,"Hines, A.

Indirect effects of MPAs on marine food webs and consumer behavior can be revealed through the diet of generalist predators, like octopuses, since their diet is a reflection of both preference and prey availability. Octopuses (Octopus bimaculatus Verrill, 1883) and invertebrate prey species were collected around Santa Catalina Island, CA in the summer of 2012, 2013, and 2014, and muscle tissues were analyzed for δ13C and δ15N. The δ13C and δ15N signature of octopuses caught within the MPA area and the non-MPA area were compared within diet space. Estimated contribution of prey species to octopus diet was calculated using a Bayesian mixing model. Octopuses caught in MPA areas had significantly different isotopic signatures than octopuses caught outside MPA areas in 2012 and 2013, but not 2014. Prey contributions to diet were highly variable between areas and years. Bivalves were a consistent contributor to MPA octopus diet, and the large snail Megastrea undosa (W. Wood, 1828) made up a relatively large proportion of the diet of octopuses from all areas and years. Additionally, there were more moray eels, a nocturnal predator outside MPA areas but more diurnal predators inside MPA areas. These results suggest octopus foraging behavior could be influenced by variation in predation risk reveal an indirect impact of diurnal predator recovery in the MPA. To fully understand the impact of anthropogenic change on marine environments, we must assess changes in the entire community and the interactions that drive community function.",2018-05,96-108,,1,36,,malb,"Variation in Octopus bimaculatus Verrill, 1883 Diet as Revealed through δ13C and δ15N Stable Isotope Analysis",,,,,,"Hofmeister, J.

Studies of the effects of structural complexity on predator–prey interactions typically vary seagrass shoot density, biomass, or architecture. Filamentous epiphytic algae commonly grow on seagrass blades and add structure to seagrasses, but the effect of epiphytes on the outcome of predator–prey interactions has rarely been explored. This study determined the relative effects of simulated seagrass epiphytes, eelgrass (Zostera marina) shoot density, and prey density on the foraging behaviors of a common predator, the juvenile giant kelpfish Heterostichus rostratus (Girard, 1854) and on escape responses of their prey, grass shrimp Hippolyte californiensis (Holmes, 1895). Juvenile giant kelpfish hunted for grass shrimp in a laboratory experiment in which two levels of grass shrimp density were crossed with three levels of structural complexity (low density artificial eelgrass, low density artificial eelgrass with artificial epiphytes, and high density artificial eelgrass). Increased structural complexity had variable effects on juvenile kelpfish activity levels, but enhanced their success at catching prey after detection, resulting in no net effect of structural complexity on the total number of prey captured. Grass shrimp made fewer escape attempts in high vs. low structural complexity, which may have enhanced kelpfish foraging success because kelpfish rarely pursued fleeing prey. Prey density did not influence kelpfish behaviors or the total amount of prey they consumed. These results suggest that it is important to consider how different forms of habitat complexity affect the mechanisms by which predators hunt for prey in structured marine habitats.",1/1/16,142-147,,,474,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,Mesopredator foraging success in eelgrass (<i>Zostera marina</i> L.),,,,,,"Hovel, K.

We use phylogenetic comparative methods to examine evolutionary trade‐offs associated with camouflage in the crab superfamily Majoidea. The majoids, or spider crabs, are known for their decoration behavior in which they attach materials from their environment to hooked setae on their carapace. We found that coverage of hooked setae on a crab (morphology) strongly predicts decoration cover in the field (behavior). Half of the species examined exhibited decreases in the coverage of hooked setae with ontogeny, and we also found a strong negative correlation between the extent of hooked setae and adult body size among species using independent contrasts, suggesting that size may constrain the evolution of camouflage. Finally, using a well‐resolved clade of epialtids (kelp crabs)—many of which decorate little but use color change as an alternative camouflage strategy—we found a negative correlation between utilization of decoration versus color camouflage strategies. Our findings suggest that the costs of hook production and decoration maintenance and/or the lowered adaptive value of camouflage for larger species may limit the evolutionary distribution of decoration camouflage among the majoids.",2009-05,566-578,,5,173,,,Evolution of Decoration in Majoid Crabs,,,,,,"Hultgren, K.

To quantify crab feeding preferences, we collected P. gracilis from San Juan Island, WA and conducted no-choice and choice experiments with two food sources: the native kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, and the invasive seaweed, Sargassum muticum. In no-choice experiments, P. gracilis ate equal amounts of N. luetkeana and S. muticum. However, in choice experiments, P. gracilis preferred N. luetkeana over S. muticum. To test effects of temperature on these feeding rates, we exposed P. gracilis to ambient (11.5 ± 1.3 ◦C) or elevated (19.5 ± 1.8 ◦C) temperature treatments and measured consumption of the preferred food type, N. luetkeana. Crabs exposed to elevated temperatures ate significantly more than those in the ambient treatment. Our study demonstrates the diet flexibility of P. gracilis, suggesting they may be able to exploit increasing populations of invasive S. muticum in the Salish Sea.

Varying effects of a single disease among multiple susceptible hosts could benefit relatively resistant species. Beginning in 2013, an outbreak of sea star wasting disease (SSWD) led to population declines of many sea star species along the west coast of North America. Through field surveys and laboratory experiments, we investigated how and why the relative abundances of two co-occurring sea star species, Evasterias troschelii and Pisaster ochraceus, shifted during the ongoing wasting epidemic in Burrard Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. We hypothesized that Evasterias is competitively inferior to Pisaster but more resistant to SSWD. Thus, we predicted that SSWD-induced declines of Pisaster could mitigate the negative effects of SSWD on Evasterias, as the latter would experience competitive release. We document shifts in sea star abundance from 2008–2017: Pisaster abundance and mean size declined during the outbreak, while Evasterias abundance increased from relatively rare to numerically dominant within the intertidal. When exposed to symptomatic sea stars, Pisaster and Evasterias both showed signs of SSWD, but transmission and susceptibility was lower in Evasterias. Despite diet overlap documented in our field surveys, Evasterias was not outcompeted by Pisaster in laboratory trails conducted with the relatively small Pisaster available after the outbreak. Interference competition with larger Pisaster, or prey exploitation by Pisaster during the summer when Evasterias is primarily subtidal, may explain the rarity of Evasterias prior to Pisaster declines. Our results suggest that indirect effects mediated by competition can mask some of the direct effects of disease outbreaks, and the combination of direct and indirect effects will determine the restructuring of a community after disturbance.",4/24/19,20182766,,1901,286,,,,,,,,,"Kay, S.

Mean densities ranged from 6.5 to 12.7 urchins 0.25 m-2. The population consisted primarily of urchins up to 40 mm in test diameter in a size distribution which changed from unimodal to bimodal and back over the 2 yr study. Mortality was temporally variable and related to test diameter. Growth rates were somewhat lower than most previous reports for the species and suggested that most of the population was made up of 1 and 2 yr-old individuals.

Prevalence of H. cyclopterina (8%) was considerably lower than that of H. intermedius (46%).

While many studies have demonstrated that ink and opaline are repellent to predators, very little is known about which components of these secretions are active against predators. Ink was previously shown to facilitate the escape of Aplysia from predatory anemones (Anthopleura) by eliciting tentacle retraction and/or shriveling, and gastrovascular eversion, but the metabolites mediating this interaction were not identified. We investigated the metabolites in Aplysia californica secretions that were aversive to the anemone Anthopleura sola, as demonstrated by tentacle shriveling and/or retraction. We found that ink elicited tentacle shriveling and/or retraction, while opaline elicited a feeding response. The active components in ink do not appear to be diet-dependent, as ink was aversive regardless of diet (natural seaweed diet vs. Gracilaria ferox). Furthermore, metabolites extracted from G. ferox were not aversive, suggesting that the aversive components are produced by the sea hares. We then examined escapin, a protein in ink with antimicrobial properties. Escapin quickly forms reaction products when mixed with the amino acids l-lysine and l-arginine, which would occur when ink and opaline are released into the sea hare mantle cavity. Neither escapin alone nor escapin mixed with its amino acid substrate l-lysine elicited aversive behaviors either immediately before or 2 min before applying to the tentacles. In addition, escapin mixed with opaline and applied to tentacles after 2 min did not elicit a significant aversive response. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, we attempted to isolate the components in A. californica ink that are aversive to A. sola. We determined that multiple components in ink, including both lipophilic and hydrophilic constituents, elicited aversive responses. We hypothesize that these components may facilitate A. californica's escape from A. sola by eliciting tentacle shriveling and/or retraction, which lead to anemones dropping ensnared sea hares.",7/11/06,256-268,,2,334,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,,,,,,"Kicklighter, C.

Experimental manipulation of food availability and accessibility indicated that D. ornata size was food limited on a time scale of < 1 yr, but that density either took longer to respond or was not affected by food availability. Worm transplantation experiments also supported size, but not density, dependence on food abundance. D. ornata size distributions observed in the field suggest that other factors, such as storm disturbance, may partially compensate for the food effect.",4/28/92,253-272,,2,156,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,The role of drift kelp in the population ecology of a <i>Diopatra ornata</i> Moore (Polychaeta,,,,,,"Kim, S.

These cryptic fishes were generally depredated in low numbers. Where syngnathids formed a high proportion of predator diets, predation occurred on (1) a single abundant species during a population boom or large die-off, (2) concentrations of individuals utilising floating marine vegetation, or (3) juveniles when abundant during the breeding season. Predation coinciding with high syngnathid densities suggests their predators are foraging opportunistically rather than targeting syngnathids as prey. Invertebrates, fishes, sea turtles, waterbirds and marine mammals were all syngnathid predators: these included taxa that do not frequent the demersal habitat generally occupied by seahorses and pipefishes. Thus, seahorses and pipefishes may be moving in the open ocean more than suspected, perhaps using floating mats of marine vegetation. If so, this behaviour could act as a hitherto unknown vector for syngnathid movement and dispersal. Information on syngnathid abundance in predator diet (measured as percent number, volume, or mass) was available in 45 reviewed accounts; in 27% (n = 12) of these studies seahorses or pipefishes comprised ≥20% of predator diet (range 0.005–100%).

Investigations of the links between copepod feeding and production suggest that dietary diversity is often a key to the procurement of a nutritionally complete ration, and the optimization of secondary production within constraints dictated by the physical environment. The ability to eat different kinds of foods (omnivory) and the tendency to include a variety of foods in the daily ration may enhance the probability of obtaining a nutritionally complete ration in variable, nutritionally dilute, food environments. The notion that the relationship between feeding and production in copepods is driven by dietary diversity is derived in part from a recent recognition of the diversity of microplanktonic organisms that potentially or actually contribute to the diet. Further, the concept is consistent with current trophic dynamic models in which food webs are envisioned as complex interwoven systems rather than short, simple chains.",1993,183-195,,2-Jan,99,,,,,,,,,"Kleppel, G.

Kelp forests are complex and diverse marine ecosystems, and kelp biomass and NPP can vary widely due to processes including trophic cascades and consequent changes in grazing pressure, storm wave disturbance, and changes in ocean climate and nutrients. Kelp, like other foundation species, clearly modulates the physical environment in which species interact: dense canopies of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera shade the reef, shaping the benthic community, and dampen flow through the forest. Yet little quantitative work has investigated the trophic contribution of kelps to kelp forest food webs. Here, we show that giant kelp provides significant trophic support to fishes living in the canopy of the kelp forest. Carbon contributions from kelp, via mesograzer prey, relative to pelagic carbon sources, increased with increasing trophic level of fishes, showing that giant kelp is particularly important to top predators. These findings suggest that losses of giant kelp would have significant consequences for coastal ecosystems and have important implications for the conservation and management of temperate reef ecosystems.",10/14/15,8-Jan,,,537,,,,,,,,,"Koenigs, C., Miller, R.

However, faunal density and biomass typically increase with seagrass structural complexity, such that variation in prey or predator density may contribute to or alter relationships between structural complexity and prey survival. We determined whether variability in prey density alters relationships between seagrass structural complexity and (1) prey survival, (2) predator–prey encounter rates, and (3) behavioral components of predator–prey interactions in eelgrass Zostera marina habitat. Using transplanted eelgrass in laboratory mesocosms, we compared trends in mesopredator (juvenile giant kelpfish Heterostichus rostratus) feeding success and behavior, and predator avoidance behavior by prey (grass shrimp Hippolyte californiensis) between experiments in which we (1) held prey density constant while increasing eelgrass shoot density, or (2) increased prey density while increasing eelgrass shoot density. We found that increasing prey density (but not eelgrass density) enhanced proportional prey survival and decreased the probability that mesopredators would attack prey, whereas increasing eelgrass density (but not prey density) decreased the likelihood that prey would attempt to escape from mesopredator attack. Predator–prey encounter rates were influenced both by prey density and eelgrass density, whereas mesopredator attack success was not influenced by either eelgrass density or prey density. Our results suggest that variable prey density modifies relationships between habitat structure and prey survival through a variety of behavioral mechanisms, and that factors that covary with habitat structure, such as prey density, may alter the effects of habitat structure on predation.",12/5/11,59-70,,,442,,,,,,,,,"Lannin, R., & Hovel, K.

The intestinal tract of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, consists of two loops, the first clockwise, the second counter-clockwise (as seen looking in at the mouth). Both loops are well supplied with glands.2. Experiments present evidence for an amylase and a proteinase in the sea urchin intestine but none for enzymes capable of digesting entire algae or agar. However, the extract of ground gut was capable of digesting iridophycin, a galactan from the red alga, Iridophycus.3. Agar-digesting bacteria are present in the second loop of the intestine in large numbers from 106 to 107 per ml. of gut contents. Total bacteria as determined by a count with a Petroff-Hauser counting chamber reach the value of 2 x 1011 per ml. They are largely confined to the pellicle which surrounds each particle of alga.4. The bacteria inoculated from the gut of the sea urchin are capable of completely digesting the alga, Iridophycus flaccidum, in the course of a week. Many of the intestinal bacteria are capable of digesting agar. Pure cultures of agardecomposing bacteria were isolated from the intestine.5.

No striking changes occur in the latter during the breeding season, but the sugar falls to zero or nearly zero on starvation. Glucose injected into the body fluid is removed by the tissues.8.

Second, we document differential predation on members of a herbivorous limpet guild (primarily Collisella spp.) by a wintering flock that expanded into a previously unexploited portion of the island. For 4 of the 5 prey species (Collisella digitalis, C. scabra, C. limatula, Lottia gigantea) there was evidence for differential predation, either selection or avoidance, by the oystercatchers. However, no single causal mechanism explains the pattern for all 4 species.

Trends in food-capture performance over early ontogeny were quantified for leopard sharks Triakis semifasciata and whitespotted bamboosharks Chiloscyllium plagiosum by measuring suction pressure and flow in front of the mouth during feeding. At any size, C. plagiosum produce greater subambient pressure and ingest more rounded water parcels. Maximum subambient pressure scaled with negative allometry in T. semifasciata and was accompanied by an increase in the time to reach maximum gape. Despite a similar trend in buccal expansion timing, maximum pressure in C. plagiosum scaled with isometry and was accompanied by an earlier onset of hyoid depression and a positive allometric increase in buccal reserve volume. Growth was the primary factor responsible for developmental trends in both species, with size-independent behavioural changes contributing little to overall performance variability. Ontogenetic dietary shifts are predicted for both species as a consequence of size-dependent changes in performance. Chiloscyllium plagiosum becomes anatomically and behaviourally canalized towards suction feeding, limiting the effective range of prey capture and possibly necessitating stalking.

In this study, the ontogeny of feeding behavior and morphology were investigated in neonatal and young-of-the-year leopard sharks Triakis semifasciata using morphometric measurements of growth and high-speed videography in a longitudinal study. Five food types were used during filming sessions to facilitate differentiation of modulation and variation over ontogeny. Functional aspects of muscle and buccal volume scaling were investigated through dissection. Growth over ontogeny was shown to influence numerous kinematic variables, while intra- and inter-individual variability was the dominant factor affecting feeding behavior. Modulation of feeding behavior based on food size and elusiveness was present for timing variables and predator motion during the strike, but not for food motion or the relative extent of buccal expansion. Allometric growth occurred in all aspects of external cranial morphology measured, resulting in a shallower head profile, anterior displacement of the mouth, and relatively larger jaw musculature over ontogeny. While the degree to which morphology constrains or enhances behavior cannot be directly quantified, variability in behavior greatly exceeds variability in morphology over early ontogeny.

Through analysis of 78,152 chaetognaths from a monthly zooplankton time series (Jan 1996–Dec 1998) collected in the Mexican Central Pacific twelve acanthocephalan larvae parasitizing chaetognaths were discovered. This is the first record of an acanthocephalan parasitizing chaetognaths, raising to 13 the types of symbionts known to interact with them (excluding predators). Cystacanth larval specimens of Corynosoma sp. (Polymorphidae) were observed parasitizing the head, trunk and caudal cavities of three of the eight chaetognath species inhabiting this tropical coastal region (Flaccisagitta enflata, Flaccisagitta hexaptera and Zonosagitta bedoti). Because Corynosoma sp. parasitized chaetognaths during different months and years (Jan–Feb 1996, Mar and Jul 1997, Jan, Jun, Aug–Sep 1998) and because the total length of these cystacanths varied between 165–480 µm, suggesting growth inside the hosts, we conclude that chaetognaths are intermediate hosts of Corynosoma sp. The twelve parasitized chaetognaths were juveniles (without gonads) or immature adults (none in reproductively mature stage IV); therefore Corynosoma may have a negative influence on host reproduction. Marine crustaceans (amphipods, decapods, copepods, mysids and euphausiids) and fishes are common intermediate or paratenic hosts of acanthocephalans. Fish, sea birds and marine mammals are definitive hosts for marine Corynosoma species. The present discovery implies that acanthocephalans are transmitted trophically through different intermediate hosts (crustaceans, chaetognaths and/or fish); thus chaetognaths can also be part of the marine acanthocephalan life cycle.",1/1/17,,,2,62,,,,,,,,,"Lozano-Cobo, H., Gómez-Gutiérrez, J., Franco-Gordo, C., & Prado-Rosas, M.

We investigated the occurrence of chemical alarm signals and responses in four species of brittle stars: Amphipholis squamata, Ophionereis reticulata, Ophiactis savignyi and Ophiothrix angulata. Additionally, the effect of microhabitat on alarm-signal recognition was tested for O. savignyi. Brittle-star homogenate was released above individuals in an aquarium, and the duration of their immediate escape response was noted and compared to the control. The broadest recognition was observed for A. squamata, which showed an escape reaction to the damage-released stimuli of all brittle stars tested. Similarly broad recognition was observed for individuals of O. savignyi that were collected from the same algal species occupied by A. squamata, a microhabitat where these individuals co-occurred with each other and with juveniles of O. angulata. The similar size and habit of these species probably expose them to the same predators, and therefore, the alarm signal of one species represents a real risk of predation to the others. In contrast, individuals of O. angulata and O. savignyi collected from sponges did not respond to stimuli from either conspecific or heterospecific individuals. The reduction in predation pressure granted by their chemically protected hosts seems to be responsible for this lack of response. The fourth species, O. reticulata, only responded conspecifically.

In this paper we summarize current knowledge of the distribution, ecology, and reproductive biology of 4 encrusting species in the soft coral family Alcyoniidae, with descriptions of 2 new genera and 2 new species. The new genus Discophyton is erected for Alcyonium rudyi, a species common in the lower intertidal of exposed rocky headlands from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada south to Point Lobos, California, USA. Discophyton rudyi n. gen. & n. comb. propagates extensively by clonal fission, giving rise to characteristic aggregations of small, regularly spaced, disc-shaped colonies. We describe 2 new species and place them in a new genus, Thrombophyton. Thrombophyton coronatum n. gen. & n. sp. forms irregularly shaped, membranous colonies on rock surfaces; it occurs subtidally along the southern California coast from the Palos Verdes Peninsula to San Diego and on the California Islands. Thrombophyton trachydermum n. gen. & n. sp. has a similar, membranous growth form; it occurs both intertidally and subtidally on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, and in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington, and intertidally in central California, USA. Alcyonium pacificum, reported for the first time from North American waters, occurs in subtidal kelp beds around the Aleutian islands of Attu and Adak; its mushroom-shaped colonies are raised above the substrate on a short stalk. D. rudyi, T. trachydermum, and A. pacificum are all gonochores that reproduce in late summer; in contrast, T. coronatum appears to reproduce in the spring. D. rudyi and T. coronatum brood larvae internally to a late planula stage.

Adults winter on salt water but salt tolerance may entail costs (e.g. maintenance of salt glands) and favor reduced parental use of marine resources for feeding chicks. Diets of Ring-billed Gull chicks nesting on a marine island off Prince Edward Island, Canada, were investigated using soft regurgitant collection and stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) analysis of both regurgitants and blood samples. Isotopic signatures in blood of chicks of Ring-billed and sympatrically-nesting Herring (L. argentatus) and Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus) were also compared. Regurgitants of Ring-billed Gull chicks contained freshwater/ terrestrial and marine invertebrates and fish. A stable isotope mixing model incorporating both δ13C and δ15N in chick regurgitants and blood estimated that 42.2% of Ring-billed Gull chick diet came from the marine environment, whereas estimates from blood for Herring and Great Black-backed Gulls were 43.6%, and 73.5%, respectively. Further, differences existed among gull species in estimates for dietary contribution from various food sources from marine and terrestrial/freshwater environments. Although Ring-billed Gulls can use marine food sources to feed their young, whether salt in marine food imposes a physiological cost on these young in comparison to young reared exclusively on non-marine foods is unclear.",2009-12,507-513,,4,32,,cowa,,,,,,,"McLellan, N.

The experiment involved complete removal of a larger (up to 600 g average wet weight) starfish (Pisaster ochraceus) from a small island—reef and addition of them to a second island—reef while a third reef served as a control. In response to Pisaster removal, the mean individual wet weight of the smaller (maximum size = 45 g wet weight) asteroid (Leptasterias hexactis) increased significantly in 15 months. Addition of Pisaster resulted in a significant decrease in Leptasterias size; no change in average Leptasterias size was observed on the control reef. A highly significant inverse correlation between the estimated biomass densities (wet weight/m2) of the two species at 10 areas suggests that competition is widespread and that the species are generally in competitive equilibrium. A major consequence of the small size of Leptasterias is an apparent inability to capture larger prey. Coexistence seems based upon 'specialization' by each predator on different—sized prey. Evidently, reduced competition stress results in an increase in Leptsterias's community role as a predator. Conversely, when competition is severe, the community role of Leptasterias appears unimportant.",1972,635-644,,4,53,,,,,,,,,"Menge, B. A. (1972).

Although habitat structure at different scales often covaries, studies rarely examine the relative effects of structure at multiple scales on faunal density and diversity. In shallow-water seagrass systems, epifaunal density at local scales generally increases with increased habitat structural complexity (e.g. shoot density per unit area). In turn, structural complexity often varies with other aspects of habitat structure at patch scales, such as proximity to patch edges, which itself modifies ecological processes that structure epifaunal communities. We conducted surveys and a manipulative experiment in the eelgrass Zostera marina beds of San Diego Bay, California, USA, to determine (1) whether eelgrass structural complexity, epifaunal density and diversity, and fish (predator) density and diversity vary with proximity to patch edges, and (2) the relative influences of structural complexity, proximity to patch edges and predator presence on epifaunal distribution. Seagrass structural complexity generally increased from patch edges to patch interiors at all sites and in all sampling periods. However, patterns of epifaunal density, diversity, and biomass varied among sites and sampling periods, with density and biomass increasing from patch edges to interiors at some sites and decreasing at others. In the manipulative experiment, we allowed epifauna to colonize sparse or dense artificial seagrass habitat at both the edge and interior of a seagrass patch, and enclosed a subset of experimental units in predator exclusion cages. Overall, proximity to patch edges had a larger influence on epifaunal density and community structure than did structural complexity or predation, with the exception of some common taxa which responded more strongly to either complexity or predator exclusion. Our results emphasize the importance of addressing and evaluating habitat structure at multiple scales to better understand the distribution and interactions of organisms in a particular environment.",2010,1299-1311,,8,119,,,,,,,,,"Moore, E.

In Southern California, brown box crabs are thought to occupy a broad depth gradient (intertidal zone -547 m), which exposes them to temperatures ranging from 8℃ -24°C. This large temperature span presents challenges for these ectothermic animals because the rates of their physiological processes, and ultimately their dietary needs, behavior, and health, vary with temperature. Here we examined how temperature affects the feeding behavior of brown box crabs to better understand their ecology in warmer regions of their distribution. Adult crabs were exposed to one of three temperature treatments (8℃, 15°C, and 20℃, N=10) for 2 months. Weekly throughout the exposure period, crabs were given two similar-sized prey items of different crushing strength (clam and mussel). Claw pinch force, prey preference, time to consume prey, and number of prey consumed were recorded prior to the start of the experiment and weekly for the duration of the study, with the exception of pinch force, which was recorded bi-weekly. We hypothesized that crabs will have a stronger pinch force at warmer temperatures, prefer prey items that require less breaking force at the coldest temperature, consume prey faster at warmer temperatures, and consume more prey at warmer temperatures. Our results confirm that pinch force is consistently greater at 15°C compared to 8°C, however, crabs at 8°C consumed more clams (higher strength) while those at 15°C consumed more mussels. Crabs at 8°C also consumed prey items faster than crabs at 15°C but ate a similar number of prey. Furthermore, there was 100% mortality at 20℃ within 8 days of exposure, indicating their proximity to lethal limits within Southern California. These results show that brown box crab feeding behavior exhibits temperature thresholds, which may alter their nutritional state, community interactions, and distribution under both short-term and long-term changes in ocean temperature.",9/8/23,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moretto, W.

This is the first record of the genus Oscarella from the Eastern Pacific. The new species is characterized by its light brown to rusty orange color, undulated appear-ance, bumpy, microlobate surface, soft, slimy consistency, two particular kinds of cells with inclusions, and occurrence in the intertidal high zone. It sometimes thrives in laboratory conditions, indicating that predators may limit its vertical distribution on the shore. The new species of Oscarella is clearly different in external morpholo-gy and cell content from all previously described species of Oscarella, thus giving low support to the hypothesis that it is an invasive species. Instead, it appears to have been previously overlooked because it is inconspicuous and relatively uncommon in the field, and because it could not be distinguished from Halisarca sacra de Laubenfels, 1930 or Halisarca sp. in keys to the West Coast sponge fauna.

A feeding trial was designed to cover a full reproductive cycle in young adult green abalone, Haliotis fulgens, consisting of five diet treatments: the macrophytic algal phaeophyte Egregia menziesii, rhodophyte Chondracanthus canaliculatus, chlorophyte Ulva lobata, a composite of the three algae and a starvation control. The lipid class, fatty acid, sterol and 1-O-alkyl glyceryl ether profiles were determined for foot, hepatopancreas/gonad tissues and larvae. The major fatty acids were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-7)c, 18:1(n-9)c, 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) and 22:5(n-3), as well as 14:0 for abalone fed brown and red algae. 4,8,12-Trimethyltridecanoic acid, derived from algae, was detected for the first time in H. fulgens (hepatopancreas complex, 1.2–13.9%; larvae, 0.5% of total fatty acids). Diacylglyceryl ethers were present in larvae (0.6% of total lipid). The major 1-O-alkyl glycerols were 16:0, 16:1 and 18:0. Additionally, 18:1(n-9) was a major component in hepatopancreas/gonad and larvae. The major sterol was cholesterol (96–100% of total sterols).

Utilization of Kelp-Bed Resources in Southern California,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/22w5w2zp,"This bulletin is one of three large publications summarizing kelp investigations at the University of California's Institute of Marine Resources. The general objective of the bulletin is to assess the impact of man's past, present, and future activities on the kelp-bed environment. Possibilities for future improvement are examined in the opening chapters which describe the life history of the giant-kelp plant and show how this knowledge can be used for culturing and transplanting. Ecology of kelp-bed fishes is treated in detail as a background for evaluating influences of human activities. The distributions and ranges of physical parameters important to fishes are outlined with emphasis on temperature, wave action, visibility, and topography. Diets, behavior, preferred habitats, abundances, and life histories of kelp fishes are described, showing the ecological roles played by kelp as a food source, shelter, attractant, and vehicle for making phytoplankton productivity more available to associated fauna. It was found, however, that kelp was not a habitat requirement for most fishes, nor did it increase species diversity significantly. There was evidence that it may contribute to greater standing crops of fishes but bottom topography was considered a more important attractant. It was estimated that kelp harvesting removed an annual maximum of about 10 percent of the food supplies available for fishes. This was not considered serious because generally there appear to be ample food reserves in kelp beds.Statistical correlations were sought between harvest returns and sportfish catches and catches per unit of effort. Neither statewide totals nor selected situations representing southern, northern, and island environments yielded any relation. Analyses were broken down to the more important groups or species of sportfishes and the only relation observed was a negative correlation between California barracuda catches and harvest yields. Since barracuda are pelagic the relation was considered to be indirect, resulting from interactions with ocean temperature. Fishing was better in beds harvested more frequently. Fishing in deteriorating beds was analyzed. Generally emphasis shifted to new groups of sportfish when more conventional fisheries declined. Statistical treatment was extended to comparisons of adjacent kelp beds that had been subjected to quite different intensities of harvesting. Harvest yield was not affected by harvesting intensity for the 11-year period examined.Kelp was sampled as it came aboard a harvesting vessel and about one third of the motile canopy fauna was removed from the habitat. The attached fauna, however, was entirely removed. Physiological studies indicated that cutting did not influence photosynthesis in adjacent kelp tissues of the cut frond. Growth of young fronds was, in some cases, retarded for periods up to a month but in other cases growth was stimulated. The complex interplay of environmental variables probably determined the character of any changes in growth rate. The interplay was described by a mathematical model and five cutting experiments were undertaken to test model predictions. Results were considered satisfactory.It was generally concluded that giant kelp encourages development of a rich associated fauna. No adverse influence of harvesting could be found among the statistics or field observations for the periods studied. The need for intelligent management is stressed to ensure that optimum utilization of the kelp resources will continue.",1968,,,,,,,,,,,,,"North, W. J., & Hubbs, C. L. (1968). Fish Bulletin 139.

Laboratory studies, including a complete energy budget in which calories of ingestion, egestion, growth, and reproduction are known, gave data on assimilation efficiency (62%) and maximum possible growth rates (small individuals, 7 to 9% wet wt/day; large, 2.1 to 3.8%).

Elasmobranch fishes are the earliest known vertebrates to develop an acid secreting stomach and as such may make a good comparative model for determining the causative factors behind these differences. We measured gastric pH and temperature continuously during periods of fasting in captive free-swimming nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum) using autonomous pH/temperature data-loggers. All nurse sharks secreted strong gastric acids (minimum pH 0.4) after feeding; however, for most of the sharks, pH increased to 8.2–8.7, 2–3 days after feeding. Half of the sharks also exhibited periodic oscillations in pH when the stomach was empty that ranged from 1.1 to 8.7 (acid secretion ceased for 11.3±4.3 h day−1). This is in contrast to the gastric pH changes observed from leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) in a previous study, where the stomach remains acidic during fasting. The leopard shark is a relatively active, more frequently feeding predator, and continuous acid secretion may increase digestive efficiency. In contrast, the nurse shark is less active and is thought to feed less frequently.

This resulted in a biomass shortage, and consequently the wholesale prices peaked in the last years and the future of this industry is uncertain. It is also recognized that, to date, there is not any known commercial cultivation of this species, mostly due to its slow growth. Ecologically, P. capillacea fronds act as nurseries and as a macroalgal habitat for several marine invertebrates and are an “hot spot” for opportunistic bacteria. In addition, algal fronds or parts of them are directly used as food by several marine grazers (e.g. turtles, fishes, gastropods and sea urchins).

We examined the interactions between micropredatory gnathiid isopods and juvenile damselfish Acanthochromis polyacanthus, the only fish on the Great Barrier Reef without a pelagic larval stage. Compared to most other fishes, A. polyacanthus can potentially interact with reef-based micropredators much earlier in life. To determine whether gnathiid isopods feed on juvenile A. polyacanthus, 150 juvenile fish sub-sampled from 20 fish broods were surveyed for ectoparasites and micropredators. Gnathiids were associated with 5 A. polyacanthus broods with mean standard lengths (SL) between 4.2 and 21.1 mm. Gnathiids were also found attached to 5 individual A. polyacanthus juveniles <10 mm SL. To determine if infection is detrimental, and/or if juveniles eat gnathiids, we exposed juveniles from a range of sizes (7.2 to 23.5 mm SL) to an individual third stage gnathiid Gnathia falcipenis for 6 h. Gnathiids fed on 29% of fish and gnathiid feeding success was significantly reduced by time in captivity. In 99% of these infections, gnathiids were not eaten afterwards, indicating that micropredation and predation were mutually exclusive. In 40% of trials the fish ate the gnathiid before the gnathiid could feed on the fish, and the probability of gnathiids being eaten was significantly greater for larger fish. Gnathiids only caused mortality in fish <10 mm SL.

Attacking barnacles by using the shell spine may represent a second widespread feeding mechanism (in addition to drilling) in muricacean gastropods. Specialization of the shell spine for attacking barnacles is advantageous over drilling within the context of an optimal foraging theory. Rockey intertidal field and laboratory experiments at Palos Verdes and Los Angeles, California, respectively, in 1981–1982 revealed, that snails with a shell spine have lower handling times and feed at a greater rate than spineless snails which drill their prey. Spine penetration of prey as opposed to drilling takes considerably less time than a tidal cycle. This is expected to increase the success rate for completion of feeding, since during tidal flux snails risk being dislodged. Plasticity in attack mechanisms allows A. spirata with broken spines to penetrate prey by drilling while undergoing spine repair. Differences exist in spine-feeding by A. spirata on B. glandula and C. fissus. The attack process takes more than twice as long when snails attack B. glandula versus C. fissus. However, there is no difference in the mean number of spine thrusts required to penetrate the opercular plates of the two species. When feeding on the larger barnacle B. glandula, A. spirata ingests significantly greater dry weight per unit handling time than with C. fissus.",8/1/85,51-58,,1,88,,Mar.

Laboratory tests of the feeding behavior of Protothaca with and without each of four common consumers suggest that the presence of consumers did not cause sufficient disruption of feeding to produce the growth differences observed in clean sand. However, monthly seining data over 16 months revealed the persistent abundance of three fishes, Leptocottus armatus Girard, Hypsopsetta guttulata (Girard), and Paralichthys californicus (Ayres), containing abundant Protothaca staminea and Macoma spp. siphons in their stomachs. Estimates of habitat-specific intensity of siphon nipping suggest that the rate of cropping per individual Protothaca was 30 to 92% lower in the muddy sand, in part because of a switch to the more abundant deposit-feeding bivalve, Macoma nasuta (Conrad).

These included colonies with heavy (Alcatraz, Anacapa), moderate (Moss Landing), and relatively little (Southeast Farallon, Santa Barbara Island) urban influence. General aspects of habitat selection were similar on all colonies, with birds seeking nest sites sheltered from the prevailing wind, and generally avoiding grassy areas. Important differences in diet choice and habitat selection were found between urban and non-urban sites, with urban gulls relying more heavily on human refuse as food, and often locating nests adjacent to human debris and artifacts. In all colonies, Western Gulls relied heavily on fish as a primary diet item, especially when rearing offspring, and birds that took predominantly fish and other pelagic prey showed superior breeding performance. Diets of less successful birds varied among sites, with urban birds dependent on human refuse, and non-urban birds being more dependent on other seabirds and scavenging. During major El Nino/Southern Oscillation events, less successful birds on non-urban sites (i.e., Southeast Farallon) flew long distances to obtain human refuse. A captive rearing experiment in which chicks were fed diets comprised of either fish or refuse, revealed that refuse was nutritionally inadequate for normal chick development. In all colonies, only a small percentage of pairs were successful as first-time breeders, and these pairs continued to be successful over many years.

However, its effect in marine soft-sediment habitats is not well understood. This study examines the role of predation in limiting the intertidal distribution of a burrowing ghost shrimp, Callianassacaliforniensis Dana, on an Oregon tideflat. The ghost shrimp displays a distinctive zonation pattern in many Pacific northwest embayments, with dense beds of this deep burrower restricted primarily to the midintertidal zone. Direct effects of surface predators in maintaining this zonation were examined by excluding predators immediately seaward of the lower edge of a dense bed and by transplanting ghost shrimp to the low intertidal in cages. Diets and distributions of potential predators were also observed. With the exclusion of surface predators, ghost shrimp migrated downward in the intertidal zone and showed high survival in transplanted areas. Examination of predator diets indicates that at least one common fish, the stagorn sculpin Leptocottus armatus Girard, consumes large numbers of Callianassa californiensis. Because burrowing by the ghost shrimp can affect the numbers of many other tideflat organisms, restriction of this animal to higher tidal zones allows a different assemblage of species to exist in the low intertidal than otherwise would be present. Predation on the ghost shrimp is thus an important factor determining the relative species composition of many tideflats along the Pacific coast of North America.",12/16/86,143-161,,1,103,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,Predation on a burrowing shrimp,,,,,,"Posey, M.

The amount of available feeding space in the habitats frequented fluctuates widely with the daily and seasonal changes in the tidal rhythm. Shorebird species broadly overlap in their periods of peak abundance, inter— and intrahabitat distributions, and in the food organisms preyed upon. However, the totality of species differences and the transient character of migratory assemblages apparently minimizes interspecific interactions that might result in competitive exclusion. The staggering of peak population densities and differences in distribution is most pronounced among morphologically similar species. The number of individuals and species that occur in an area is apparently determined by the amount of available feeding space and the physical diversity of the habitat. Food appears to be generally abundant relative to the requirements of the birds in all the habitats studied. The environmental conditions encountered during migration and the interactions with other individuals have evidently been important factors in the evolution of morphological and behavioral differences among shorebird species.

Natural populations interact with each other in a variety of ways and, although most published ecological networks only include information about a single interaction type (e.g., feeding, pollination), ecologists are beginning to consider networks which combine multiple interaction types. Here we extend the group model to signed directed networks such as ecological interaction webs. As a specific application of this method, we examine the effects of including or excluding specific interaction types on our understanding of species roles in ecological networks. We consider all three currently available interaction webs, two of which are extended plant-mutualist networks with herbivores and parasitoids added, and one of which is an extended intertidal food web with interactions of all possible sign structures (+/+, -/0, etc.). Species in the extended food web grouped similarly with all interactions, only trophic links, and only nontrophic links. However, removing mutualism or herbivory had a much larger effect in the extended plant-pollinator webs. Species removal even affected groups that were not directly connected to those that were removed, as we found by excluding a small number of parasitoids. These results suggest that including additional species in the network provides far more information than additional interactions for this aspect of network structure. Our methods provide a useful framework for simplifying networks to their essential structure, allowing us to identify generalities in network structure and better understand the roles species play in their communities.",7/21/15,e1004330,,7,11,,PLOS Computational Biology,,,,,,,"Sander, E.

From the kinematic analysis, we determined that the moving thoracic exopodites were spatially segregated along two axes, which reduced the interference between the ipsilateral swimming appendages. The posterior thoracic exopodites, particularly the three posteriormost appendages, varied the orientation of their paths, thereby influencing the trajectory of the exhalent stream. The predominant trajectory of the paired exhalent streams was in a ventroposterior direction, but the exhalent streams could adopt more pronounced dorsal or ventral directions relative to those more commonly observed. The fact that only one exhalent stream emerged from each side of the animal suggested that the exopodites were propelling water in a synergistic fashion. Cannon and Manton (1927) claimed that the elliptical motion of the exopodites produced both swimming currents and feeding currents, the so-called ""axial currents"" that flow medially between adjacent basipodites, joining together with an anteriorly directed current between the eighth pair of endopodites in the food groove to transport food to the mouth.

At one station, urchins were more abundant outside compared to inside the kelp bed, a pattern which generally occurs in southern California. In contrast, at the other station urchins were more abundant inside the bed. This exception to the general rule indicates that the distributions were not simply determined by something associated with the presence of kelp. Samples of substrates, sea urchins and sea stars suggested that the distribution of Patiria but not Lytechinus was controlled by the availability of suitable substrates. Further experiments showed that: 1) Patiria elicit an escape response from Lytechinus, the strength of which is positively related to the size of the urchins, 2) small urchins, which react less strongly to Patiria, are preyed on more heavily than are larger ones, and 3) escape responses elicited by Patiria cause local reductions of Lytechinus in the field. We conclude from these results that predation by Patiria controls the distribution of Lytechinus at our study sites, and may account for this species distribution in kelp forests throughout southern California.

Loss of the vulnerable surface canopy typically leads to alternate rocky reef states dominated by substrate-near, understory vegetation, or reefs without any large fleshy macroalgae such as sea urchin barrens. Such alternate reef states represent a major shift in food availability and quality, and may impact kelp-preferring grazers forced to rely on less nutritious foods. Here we investigate the physiological responses of grazers to changes in food quality and quantity. We quantify the mass-independent oxygen consumption (ṀO2), as a proxy of whole-organism physiology, of four grazing invertebrate species (two sea urchins: Mesocentrotus franciscanus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; and two gastropods: Pomaulax gibberosus and Tegula pulligo) provisioned with one of three diet treatments over seven weeks: 1) higher quality, canopy kelp, 2) lower quality, substrate-near kelp, or 3) restricted: no kelp. We further test for differences in the heat resistance of four grazers using an acute, near-lethal heat exposure after completion of the provisioning period. Food restrictions had the strongest influence on oxygen consumption in the two urchins (mass-independent ṀO2 was reduced by 26–78%). By contrast, the two gastropod grazers did not display metabolic depression under food restrictions. Although kelp restrictions had clear physiological consequences in sea urchins, overall, the type of kelp provisioned (Macrocystis and Saccharina) did not relate to oxygen consumption after seven weeks. While heat resistance was also similar across food treatments, unfed individuals showed a slight tendency for lower heat tolerance compared to fed individuals. These results suggest a weak coupling between heat resistance and food quality and quantity, at least for these species and at short time spans. Our work highlights the importance of diet diversity and metabolic depression as strategies to cope with the energetic costs of warming.",12/1/23,151947,,,569,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,,,,,,"Schuster, J.

Many symbiotic cnidarians produce offspring that are initially nonsymbiotic. These new hosts must acquire symbiotic algae from environmental sources. We examined zooxanthella acquisition by laboratory-reared planula larvae of the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Larvae ingested zooxanthellae while they were feeding. However, the signal that prompted larval feeding behavior did not originate from the symbiotic algae; the addition of algal cells to larval cultures never elicited a feeding response. In contrast, the addition of macerated animal tissue from several sources invariably generated a strong feeding response, which resulted in the larvae indiscriminately ingesting any particulate matter that was present, including zooxanthellae or other unicellular algae. Ingested zooxanthellae were incorporated into endodermal cells, where they remained undigested, while all other ingested material was digested or expelled within 24 h. Our results provide evidence that one source of zooxanthellae likely to serve as a route of infection in the natural environment is zooxanthella-laden mucus egested by anemones. This egested material fulfilled both of the criteria necessary for successful infection: it prompted larvae to begin feeding and provided an abundant supply of zooxanthellae that were ingested and taken up into endodermal cells of the new host.",3/1/02,471-478,,3,140,,Marine Biology,,,,,,,"Schwarz, J., Weis, V., & Potts, D.

Attacks occurred either in mid-water or from the bottom. In mid-water, isopods would swim in from the rear, on any compass setting, adjusting their dorso-ventral swimming orientation to land with outstretched pereopods. Speed adjustments were precise since, in over 50 attacks, overshooting did not occur. From the bottom, isopods which were lying on their backs with the first three pairs of pereopods extended, either hooked a slowly passing fish or flipped their pleopods and propelled themselves onto a fish. Thus, juvenile N. acuminata are behaviorally equipped to attack either pelagic or demersal fishes. Undamaged fish did not respond overtly either to the sight of or transient contact with the isopods; damaged fish took evasive action.

However, parasites are often poorly documented and still rarely integrated into marine ecological modelling; comprehensive surveys of infection in marine invertebrates are sporadic at best. For example, rock crabs are an important part of Californian coastal ecosystems, both as regulators of mussel populations and non-native species, and as prey items for predators like sea otters, but their parasite communities and potential effects on crab population dynamics are seldom studied or understood. Here, we present the first report of infection by the trematode Helicometrina nimia in the economically and ecologically important red rock crab (Cancer productus) and Pacific rock crab (Romaleon antennarium). As intermediate hosts, they are a missing link for infection by H. nimia in Californian fish that was unreported until now.

Near Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, sea surface temperature and algal abundance fluctuate throughout the year. To investigate how these factors influence isopod growth, we plotted the body lengths of field-collected isopods against monthly sea surface temperatures, as well as against the relative abundance of coralline algae (Corallina; Amphiroa), over a 26-month period (1983–1985). We found that average body lengths of the four adult morphs in this species (α-, β-, γ-males and females), were larger in cool months and smaller in warm months. Our records of female reproductive condition at capture allowed identification of the approximate dates on which females matured, thus the effect of temperature on growth was most clearly seen in females. Monthly average body lengths correlated negatively with temperature for all adult morphotypes, with different slopes and intercepts; morphotypes undergoing more molts had steeper slopes. Coralline algae abundance showed no seasonal patterns, and we found no significant relationships between relative algal abundance and isopod body length for any adult morph. In the laboratory, animals reared at lower temperature (21°C) matured at larger body lengths than individuals reared at higher temperatures (27–30°C). However, well-fed individuals grew no more rapidly than poorly-fed individuals. Thus, variation in food availability had no recognizable effect on isopod growth in either the laboratory or in the field, whereas variation in temperature significantly influenced growth in both locations, with effects proportional to the number of pre-adult molts.",2/1/99,269-284,,2,233,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,,,,,,,"Shuster, S.

We determined the effects of western gull ( Larus occidentalis Audubon, 1839) predation on purple sea urchins in the rocky intertidal using the framework of optimal foraging theory and taking into account different prey-handling techniques. We recorded the foraging behavior of gulls, measured urchin availability, and estimated prey caloric content with bomb calorimetry. Western gulls selected purple sea urchins significantly more than other prey items (snails (genus Tegula Lesson, 1835), limpets (genus Collisella Dall, 1871), sea stars ( Pisaster giganteus (Stimpson, 1857) and Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835))). Larger urchins contained relatively more calories. Gulls foraged optimally when pecking by frequently selecting the most profitable size class. However, gulls chose smaller urchins than expected when air-dropping, which could have been influenced by group size and age. Gulls selected smaller purple sea urchins when foraging in larger groups likely owing to the risk of kleptoparasitism. Adults chose larger, and juveniles smaller, urchins when air-dropping, suggesting that juveniles are less experienced in foraging techniques.

Fish stomach analyses and a field caging experiment indicate that, although C. rostrata is preyed upon by fishes, fish predation has little effect on natural populations of this isopod. Most isopods escape detection due to their cryptic nature and, if detected, are protected from predators by an urchin spine response. In the laboratory, more isopods occur on the exposed aboral regions of urchins during nighttime hours than during daylight. This diurnal behavior may be an indirect antipredator response, since cryptic isopods are less visible to visual predators at night. Laboratory predator inclusion experiments reveal that urchins significantly reduce fish predator success on C. rostrata, regardless of host urchin species or size. Isopods escape predation better on larger urchins than on smaller urchins, although predator success is not affected by spine length in itself. Urchins provide C. rostrata with an important refuge from fish predation.

Extensive field and laboratory studies were carried out to determine the degree of ecological differentiation present in these species. The dominant species, H. gilberti and H. jenkinsi show both behavioral and ecological specializations which are lacking in H. gentilis. These differences include: Habitat preference; H. gilberti inhabits the rocky intertidal and adjacent subtidal cobble; H. jenkinsi is found only subtidally, inhabiting boring clam burrows, Serpulorbis tubes or mussel beds. Adult motility: H. gilberti is a meandering species commonly including a radius as large as 15 m within its home range. Individuals return to 'home' pools at low tide and homing has been demonstrated for displacements as great at 45 m. H. jenkinsi is sedentary rarely wandering more than a meter from its home refuge. Homing was not demonstrated in this species, even for displacements as small as 5 m. Territoriality: Degree of territoriality correlates with movement, the sedentary species is highly territorial while this phenomena is less easily demonstrated in the meandering form. The above differences have been experimentally verified in the laboratory. All species are omnivorous, differences in gut content seem to represent different habitat associations. Reproduction occurs from spring through late summer; the eggs are guarded by the male. Hatching occurs in 4—18 days depending on temperature; the larvae are pelagic for about three months. Adult size differences reflect differing larval and first year growth plus differing longevity; determinate growth has not been demonstrated. Adult size varies between the species and is an important ecological factor. In the small tubiculous species H. jenkinsi, tube size controls fish size (habitat matching) probably through predator selection. Habitats made up of different tube sizes support populations of significantly different mean fish size. In Newport Bay, population structures are altered by a viral infection, Lymphocystis which reaches epidemic levels during the warm months. The ecological differences between the three species seem to indicate that H. gentilis is the most generalized (primitive) form.

Adult kelpfish demonstrated a stronger preference for matching backgrounds than did juveniles. Kelpfish larvae whose parents colors were known were reared on red, green, or brown colored backgrounds. They developed brown or green juvenile color morphic patterns, apparently independently of parent color. These rearing experiments indicated that development of juvenile color is determined by plant background.

It was found that juveniles readily changed on both artificial and live plant backgrounds from green to brown, and vice versa. Changes in color of adults were less pronounced and slower, particularly in laboratory experiments, and largely confined to females. In situ experiments yielded the greatest magnitudes of color change, some adult females changing between red, brown and green.

1985,"Strickler, J. R.",Feeding currents in calanoid copepods: two new hypotheses,Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology,,0081-1386,,,"The interaction between planktonic herbivorous calanoid copepods and their food, planktonic algae, is investigated to increase our understanding of the physiological adaptations these small marine animals have acquired in the course of evolution. Emphasis is given to the centimetre -second scale where calanoids encounter algae, select and capture them, or reject them either passively or actively. Most calanoid copepods create feeding currents which can be subdivided into three cores: motion, viscous, and sensory cores. Algae contained in the sensory core are perceived and then re-routed towards the capture area. The perimeter encompassing all the points of these re-routings can be defined as the reactive field of awareness surrounding the calanoid. An analysis of typical biological oceanographic feeding experiments reveals that direct observations are necessary to understand the feeding behaviours and strategies of calanoid copepods. To facilitate further studies, a new experimental set-up has been described and two hypotheses have been formulated. The method allows direct observations, in all three dimensions, of free-swimming herbivorous calanoids and their food in a 6-litre vessel. The two hypotheses are based on the fact that calanoids create feeding currents and orient their bodies within the water column. The first hypothesis states that calanoid copepods create species-specific, and maybe even age-specific, feeding currents. The second one proposes that ambient water motions may act as a mechanism for niche separation in herbivorous calanoid copepods. This latter hypothesis is based on the inference that ambient water motions may interfere with the flow field of the feeding current thereby making it more difficult for calanoids to successfully re-route algae contained in the sensory core of the feeding current.",1985,459-485,,,39,,Symp Soc Exp Biol,Feeding currents in calanoid copepods,,,,,,"Strickler, J.

Agassiz) and S. purpuratus (Stimpson), which are major herbivores in southern California kelp forest communities. Aquarium experiments indicate that spiny lobsters strongly prefer S. purpuratus over S. franciscanus of comparable test diameter, probably accounting for the higher number of S. purpuratus mortalities observed in the field. Juvenile S. franciscanus (< 60 mm test diameter, TD) are preferred over larger conspecifics, but the smallest S. franciscanus (< 30 mm TD) are protected by association with the adult urchin spine canopy. Mid-sized S. franciscanus too large to fit under the spine canopy are subject to intense predation. All sizes of P. interruptus tested showed a notable reluctance to attack large S. franciscanus (> 90 mm TD) when offered a range of sizes, although the larger lobsters are capable of handling the largest urchins. Relative movement, spine length, test thickness, and gonad weights of sea urchins were examined to evaluate the factors affecting the lobsters' choice of prey, and behavioral responses to lobsters were assessed to determine urchin availability to these predators. The handling problems associated with the long spines of larger S. franciscanus appear to be the major considerations in prey choice despite the much greater potential energy gain from these urchins. Thus predation by spiny lobsters appears to be sufficient to explain the bimodal size-frequency distribution typical of S. franciscanus populations in areas where these predators are common. Heavy fishing pressure on spiny lobsters during this century probably resulted in the release of sea urchin populations and contributed to episodes of destructive urchin grazing observed in the 1950's and subsequent years.",12/8/83,125-150,,2,73,,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,Spiny lobsters and sea urchins,,,,,,"Tegner, M.

The mechanism of sorting has been well studied for many other groups of invertebrate, but until now it has remained obscure for phoronids. With the help of functional morphology data we are proposing a possible scheme of sorting in phoronids on the example of Phoronopsis harmeri. The lower limit of the particle size is defined by the distance between laterofrontal cilia of tentacles and equals 1.2 μm. Larger particles are transferred by frontal cilia to the basis of the tentacles, where they pass into the lophophoral groove. The distance between the epistome and the external row of tentacles regulates the upper limit of the particle size that are suitable for food. Only particles whose size does not exceed 12 μm get into the lophophoral groove and further into the mouth. Larger particles collect in the space above the epistome and are removed from the lophophore. The size of the food particles that phoronids consume by filtration lies in a range 1.2–12 μm. These are bacteria and small phytoplankton organisms. At the same time the significant individual mobility of the phoronid tentacles plays an important role in the expansion of the pabular spectrum to large inactive zooplankton and phytoplankton organisms reaching a size of 50–100 μm.",3/1/10,109-116,,2,36,,Russ J Mar Biol,,,,,,,"Temereva, E.

Liparocephalus cordicollis, the more abundant of the two, is a predator that feeds preferentially on small chironomid larvae. Adults and larvae of this species can withstand submergence in seawater at 10 °C for more than 2 weeks. Thus they are able to survive continuous inundation from one spring tide to the next, just above lowest tide levels. Adults of L. cordicollis are osmotic regulators and can stabilize their body weight at salinities varying from 2 to 45‰. Both of these staphylinid species respire above and below water.

Although C. gracilis megalopae and instars are not seen riding Aurelia labiata in the field, instars readily clung to A. labiata, as well as an artificial medusa, when confined in a planktonkreisel. In the laboratory, C. gracilis was observed to consume H. medusarum, P. camtschatica, Artemia franciscana and A. labiata. Crab fecal pellets contained mixed crustacean exoskeletons (70%), nematocysts (20%), and diatom frustules (8%). Nematocysts predominated in the fecal pellets of all stages and sexes of H. medusarum.

The broad range of δ 13 C (-25.2 to -19.6) and δ 15 N (10.9 to 17.5) values among crab instars reflects an increased diversity of diet as crabs develop. The association between C. gracilis and P. camtschatica is unusual because of the ontogenic switch of the symbiont from a primarily kleptoparasitic association to a facultative cleaning association. It is suggested that P. camtschatica incidentially concentrates H. medusarum in its oral arms as the sym- bionts transfer from its gelatinous prey.

A relationship between predator size and the size of juveniles of the deep-burrowing clam Tresus nuttallii taken as prey is a product of the ability of larger seastars to extend the tube feet further into the substrate and capture deeper prey.

The objectives of this study were to identify the main predators of sponges, and their principal prey, in two localities from the Sea of Cortez (Mexican Pacific Ocean). For this, 60 stomach contents were analyzed from 13 species of fishes, 23 species of opisthobranchs, and 4 species of echinoderms (urchins and starfishes). Two species of fish (Pomacanthus zonipectus and Holacanthus passer), and five species of opisthobranchs (Hypselodoris agassizii, Glossodoris sedna, Glossodoris dalli, Discodoris ketos and Tylodina fungina) included sponges in their diet. Sponge remains were not found in the echinoderm stomach contents. The two species of fish fed on 26 species of sponge; the most common were Haliclona caerulea and Spirastrella decumbens. The opistobranchs fed on 19 species, mostly Haliclona caerulea and Tethya taboga.

The nesting population at Kennedy Lake changed little over the last 16 years. Most gulls nested as solitary pairs on small islands and on tops of poles, pilings, and tree stumps emerging from the water. Distraction displays were commonly observed. Egg-laying commenced in the beginning of May and the nestlings fledged by the middle of July. The average incubation period was 25 days and the fledging period was one month. Reproductive success averaged 0.24 and 0.52 fledglings per nesting pair in 1984 and 1985, respectively. Most egg and chick mortality resulted from predation. Reproductive success was higher for pairs with greater communal defense of nests. Pellets regurgitated by adult gulls consisted mostly of crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus, a lake and river inhabitant); and regurgitations of nestlings of marine fishes. The Mew Gull in British Columbia is primarily a solitary nester confined to fresh water habitat, whereas in Europe the species nest is mostly colonially in both fresh water and marine environments. In Alaska, the Mew Gull is intermediate in extent of coloniality between the species in British Columbia and Europe. Distraction is a common and typical display of Mew Gulls in British Columbia, but not in Europe.

We examined the diet of the 3 most common species that occurred consistently over time (seasonally): Atherinops affinis, Menidia beryllina, and Leptocottus armatus. Low-order (first- and second-order) systems supported higher densities of Gambusia affinis and Lucania parva. High-order (third- and fourth-order) systems supported greater species richness and densities of juveniles, including Clupea pallasi, than low-order systems. Prey taxa richness was greater for M. beryllina and lower for L. armatus in the first-order system. There was a positive correlation between high-order channel systems and mean stomach fullness scores for L. armatus, and M. beryllina had greater short-term consumption rates in high-order channel systems.

Four methods were used to address hypothesis 1: (1) prey deliveries from adult to chick, (2) chick regurgitations, (3) dropped prey, and (4) a stable C and N isotope mixing model in R (SIAR). Pipefish contributed to 8% of identified provisions, 47% of dropped prey, 0% of regurgitations, 58% (95 CI: 0.43, 0.74) of chick diet according to whole blood analyses, and 29% (95% CI: 0, 0.61) of chick diet according to breast muscle analyses. To address hypothesis 2, we compared pipefish isotope values to those of northern anehovy, a planktonic feeder, and determined pipefish habitat use based on field collections and a laboratory experiment. Pipefish and anchovy had similar isotope values suggesting that they occupy a similar trophic position. In the lab, pipefish readily left artificial seaweed habitat whether seeking food or not. Based on field collections we found that pipefish occur not only in kelp but also away from kelp in shallow waters near the surface and near the bottom. The Elegant Tern is an opportunistic predator feeding on a variety of fish and invertebrate prey, including the once presumed cryptic species—kelp pipefish. Such foraging plasticity may be partly responsible for the tern's steady increase in nest numbers over the past 20 years in southern California.",2014,,66,,,,,,,,,"California State University, Fullerton",United States -- California,"Whitcombe, C.

Species of the shrimp families Crangonidae, Hippolytidae and Pandalidae and crabs of the Cancridae, Lithodidae, Majidae and Paguridae are particularly abundant. Many of the genera and species either are unique to the North Pacific or are found only along the west coast of North America. Compared to other marine invertebrates, decapods tend to be large and recognizable. Larger crabs, shrimp and lobsters are fished commercially for food or bait. Many species are important in food webs, feeding on small mollusks, worms, crustaceans or detritus and in turn being eaten by fishes, birds, seals or sea lions. Intertidal species have been used in behavioral or physiological research on regeneration, color changes, respiration and symbiotic relationships. Interested visitors to kelp beds and tide pools photograph and observe decapods. One must identify a species in order to study it or label its photograph. Without the needed literature or training in the anatomy of decapod crustaceans, the interested biologist must seek out the few specialists who can identify northeastern Pacific decapods. The fauna of the northeastern Pacific differs greatly at the level of genera from that of tropical regions or the western Atlantic. A person familiar with decapods of other regions may have no idea where to find information on the fauna of the northeastern Pacific, especially if the pertinent literature is in Russian. It is my hope to remedy the lack of a technical guide to decapods of the warm and cold temperate regions of the northeastern Pacific.

Particles were captured by the palps and transported to the mouth by ciliary and muscular action. Mean transport rates for cysts of Artemia from the distal ends of the palps to the mouth ranged from 0.7 to 1.3 mm/sec; those for glass beads, from 0.2 to 0.8 mm/sec. Upon reaching the mouth, particles were engulfed by the lateral lips and ingested. Worms feeding on large particles (>0.2 mm) repeatedly arched the anterior end of the body. Nauplii of Artemia were used to determine the ability of the worms to feed on small motile organisms over a 24-h period in the dark. In six trials the percentage of nauplii ingested ranged from 58% to 76%. In particle selection experiments, worms were offered uncoated glass beads and beads coated with fluid from the ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa. In two experiments 91% and 89% of coated glass beads were ingested as compared to 15% and 4% of uncoated beads, respectively.

Analysis of covariance comparing the slopes of brittle star survivorship curves followed by multiple comparisons tests revealed five groupings of sites, with significantly greater predation rates in the two offshore than in the three coastal groups. Brittle stars tethered at the three offshore sites were consumed primarily by cod, Gadus morhua, with 60–100% prey mortality occuring in 2.5 h. In striking contrast, only 6–28% of brittle star prey was consumed in the same amount of time at the four coastal sites, which were dominated by cunner, Tautogolabrus adspersus. In several coastal trials, a majority of brittle star prey remained after 24 h. The pattern of higher predation offshore held for rock crabs as well with only 2.7% of tethered crabs consumed (n=36) at coastal sites versus 57.8% of crabs (n=64) consumed at offshore sites. Another important predatory fish, the wolffish, Anarhichas lupus, consumed more tethered crabs than brittle stars. Videos and time-lapse movies indicated that cod and wolffish were significantly more abundant at offshore than at coastal sites. Three hundred years of fishing pressure in New England has severely depleted stocks of at least one important benthic predator, the cod, in coastal waters. We speculate that this human-induced predator removal has lowered predation pressure on crabs and other large mobile epibenthos in deep coastal communities.

Rising ocean temperatures associated with ongoing environmental changes have the potential to alter organismal physiology and consequently change their feeding strategies, especially in organisms with high feeding flexibility such as omnivores. In this study, we performed feeding trials with P. producta at ambient and elevated temperatures to determine if elevated temperatures characteristic of short-term heat waves induce changes in feeding rate or preferred food type. We offered crabs N. luetkeana blades, Lacuna vincta snails, or a combination of both as food options in choice and nochoice feeding trials. Our results showed that elevated temperatures did not change crab feeding rates or their preference for algal tissue versus animal tissue. When offered the two food options in choice feeding trials, crabs consistently chose to incorporate both into their diet, demonstrating that they are opportunistic consumers across a range of temperatures. The feeding behaviors of grazers and omnivores in kelp beds are impactful in shaping the habitat around them. Thus, studies such as this are essential to improving our understanding of how elevated temperatures may affect trophic interactions among kelp forest inhabitants and ecosystems.

Understanding how different aspects of sampling effort affect ecological network structure is important for both fundamental ecological knowledge and the application of network analysis in conservation and management. Using a highly resolved food web for the marine intertidal ecosystem of the Sanak Archipelago in the Eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska, we assess how commonly studied properties of network structure differ for 281 versions of the food web sampled at five levels of spatial scale representing six orders of magnitude in area spread across the archipelago. Species (S) and link (L) richness both increased by approximately one order of magnitude across the five spatial scales. Links per species (L/S) more than doubled, while connectance (C) decreased by approximately two-thirds. Fourteen commonly studied properties of network structure varied systematically with spatial scale of sampling, some increasing and others decreasing. While ecological network properties varied systematically with sampling extent, analyses using the niche model and a power-law scaling relationship indicate that for many properties, this apparent sensitivity is attributable to the increasing S and decreasing C of webs with increasing spatial scale. As long as effects of S and C are accounted for, areal sampling bias does not have a special impact on our understanding of many aspects of network structure.

Seasonally Membranipora populations varied from >1000 to less than one colony per kelp blade in late winter and late summer, respectively. Populations often varied by more than an order of magnitude in 2 wk. Several planktonic and benthic factors play important roles in the population dynamics of Membranipora. Upwelling conditions and the presence of two nudibranch predators accounted for 55% of the variability in larval abundance relative to adult population size. In turn, low recruitment rates relative to larval abundance corresponded with periods of high surface temperatures. The combined effect of larval abundance and surface temperature accounted for 79% of the Vaccinium in recruitment. Although a field transplant experiment demonstrated that predation plays a major role in the survival of colonies, recruitment was a major factor underlying population fluctuations and accounted for 75% of the variability in reproduction as indexed by the production of zooids by Membranipora colonies. A 12—fold density—dependent effect on reproduction attributable to space limination and to the density—dependent component of predation was observed over the 1000—fold range in recruitment resulting from density—independent factors. A population model based on field—derived relationships accounted for 64% of the observed variability in colony density. Temperature, as it affects recruitment, was the major factor controlling the seasonal fluctuations in Membranipora populations. Over longer, multiseasonal time scales the small density—dependent effect was capable of maintaining model populations within the range of values observed in the field and therefore was sufficient to regulate Membranipora populations.

A total of 3790 medusae were collected and examined. Stauromedusae prey consisted primarily of harpacticoid copepods (68·4%), followed by gammarid amphipods (15·4%), chironomid fly larvae (9·2%) and podocopid ostracods (5·9%). The remaining 1·1% of the diet was made up of empidid fly larvae, polychaete worms, isopods, juvenile decapod crustaceans and gastropods. Gut content was observed in 31% of the stauromedusae collected and only in medusae with an umbrella height greater than 0·4 mm. Frequency of medusae with prey items in their gut content increased with stauromedusae size. The type of prey most frequently found in the smallest medusae were copepods, whilst larger individuals contained mainly amphipods. A strong tendency for the length of prey consumed to increase with medusae size was found.",2004-04,337-340,,2,84,,,,,,,,,"Zagal, C. J. (2004).

1997,"Zhinan, Z","Phytal meiofauna of a rocky shore at the Cape d'Aguilar marine reserve, Hong Kong",The Marine Flora and Fauna of Hong Kong and Southern China IV,978-962-209-437-6,,,,"Following a three-year cycle, an International Workshop on the Marine Flora and Fauna of Hong Kong and Southern China was convened at the Swire Institute of Marine Science of the University of Hong Kong from 2-20 April 1995. Sixteen scientists from six countries and fifteen scientists and students from Hong Kong investigated aspects of the marine flora and fauna of the Cape d&#39;Aguilar proposed marine reserve and the southeastern waters of Hong Kong. The marine flora and fauna of this area of Hong Kong is poorly known and, like others locally, is threatened by pollution. Such broad-based studies of this area of Hong Kong&#39;s waters are needed urgently. The Proceedings of the workshop contain thirty-one original research papers dealing with aspects of the taxonomy and ecology of Hong Kong&#39;s marine life with particular reference to the Cape d&#39;Aguilar Marine Reserve and the benthic fauna of its territorial waters. The workshop was sponsored by the University of Hong Kong to bring scientists and students together to study the shores and seas around its infant institute of marine science. The success of the workshop is self-evident in the contents and scope of these proceedings. This venture, like the first workshop, convened in 1977, on the shores of the now disastrously polluted Tolo Harbour, is a landmark publication. It is a significant compilation of wide-ranging research papers on an area of Hong Kong that has been, hitherto, little-studied but which will, one day, be of vital conservation interest to local people, if any of the territory&#39;s now threatened marine life is to survive.",7/1/97,205,,,,,,,,,,Hong Kong University Press,,"Zhinan, Z.
