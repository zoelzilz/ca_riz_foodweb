,,26,hyperparasitism (ecto),
,,27,sessile micropredation (no host switching),
,,28,boring,
,,29,shell-dweller (requiring death of shell builder),
,,30,scavenging,
,,0,confirmed no trophic link,
justification,what evidence do we have that this link exists,1,personal observation,
,,2,in LTER or CNIP surveys,
,,3,in literature (incl. books),
,,4,inferred via shared habitat and general diet cateory,
,,5,grey literature/ internet,
,,6,more broadly in literature (e.g. group listed but not that species),
,,7,expert opinion/pers comm.,
,,9,close relative observed personally,
,,10,inferred based on closely related species in lit,
,,11,inferred based on host trophic links and known hosts from lit,
,,12,inferred based on parasite presence and known life cycle,
,,13,GLOBI,
confidence,how confident are we that this link exists,1,very certain,"applies when both species are known from CA, known to frequent RIZ, and reported or observed interacting"
,,2,certain,"applies when both species are known from CA but are reported to interact in a different part of the Eastern Pacific OR when interactions are reported at genus level and applied to all reasonable members of that genus; if both simultaneously, then downgrade to confidence of 3"
,,3,somewhat certain,applies when both species are known from CA but are reported to interact at higher taxonomic levels than genus OR when interaction is reported only from a lab setting
,,4,uncertain but plausible,"usually means link was assigned based on trophic strategy and one of the link assignment rules, e.g. the two nodes share habitat"
,,5,certain on interaction but uncertain whether parasitic or commensal,
epibiota_consumed,"if this interaction occurs, is the consumer likely to ingest organisms that are epibiotic on the resource",yes,either this trophic interaction would result in any epibionts being consumed or the listed epibiont would be consumed with the host if it were consumed,
,,no,neither of the above (epibiont is motile or is attached to a part of the host that predator would not eat),
