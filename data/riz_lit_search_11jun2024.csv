03/21/2024 11:57AM,1,interaction report,Multiple components in ink of the sea hare Aplysia californica are aversive to the sea anemone Anthopleura sola,Cynthia E.KicklighterCharles D.Derby,2006,Anthopleura sola,adult,predator,predation,Aplysia californica,species,Aplysia californica,s,y,y,"Study was done in a lab, but Anthopluera Sola was collected from San Pedro, CA and Aplysia calfornica was collected from Garden Grove, CA. ",,"*Aplysia calfornica is normally preyed upon by Anthropluera sola, but when secreting a a mix of ink and opaline, may deter predation. This study looked at the chemical components of this deterring secretion and reveals that the secretion elicits shrivling and retreat of tentacles from Anthopleura sola. However, this is from the ink, not the opaline! What I gathered is that Anthopluera sola is a potential predator to sea hares in general depending on if the sea hare will secrete ink or just opaline. Chemical interactions may play a huge role on the diet of Anthopluera sola.( Interesingly, this ink attracts the predation of the spiny lobster! )",done,03/20/2024 01:03PM,,,,,,

If that's correct, then this paper confirms that Anthopleura sola does eat sea hares, a variety of Aplysia species. They basically used their fingers to clean out the digestive cavity of these sea anemones, and within these cavities they found bits and pieces of sea hares. They also experimentally fed the aneones sea hare digestive glands and they ate them in many cases. The paper talked about how the entire sea hare is not normally eaten becauase eventually toxins ( mayne their ink? ) is expelled and deters predation, but that usually portions of the sea hare are eaten, ( such as the digestive gland?)

This paper was interesting to include because it’s hypothesis originally states that diet doesn’t change with ontogenetic shifts or changes in morphology. The paper goes on to reject this null hypothesis, showing that ontogenetic changes which affect the buccal expansion correlate to changes in diet. I felt this was a good paper to support claims from RIZ Lit Search: 110,111, etc. During this study the leopard sharks were fed Loligo opalescens, Opisthonema oglinum, and Palaemonetes pugio. However, I'm hesitant to include these organisms in the edge list because the paper states these food choices were not chosen to represent natural prey neccesarily, but instead to represent different sizes/structures of prey available.
