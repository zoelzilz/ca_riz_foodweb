## Dissection data is in one format, and I want to be able to consistently pull it in to the food web interaction matrix (totally different format)

### final product should be a csv of dissection-based interactions (dissection_interactions.csv) and append these to the original edgelist (new file: 'edgelist_complete.csv')
- with a column (in ref_num) indicating "Dissection ID: #)

```{r}
diss <- read_csv("data/dissection_data_all_3nov22.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(id, species, coll_loc, habitat, zone, stomach_contents, ectos, endos, epis, other_symbs, final_id)



```
